title: "Spiritual Successorship"
---

Spiritual successorship describes Baha'u'llah's plans for when He is no longer with us in person. The Kitab-i-Aqdas has a few paragraphs which outline His vision. This chapter will discuss these plans, as well as Baha'u'llah's explanations of these plans in His other writings. We learned some examples in the last chapter of the type of leadership Baha'u'llah did not intend. Elsewhere in the book, we have also learned about the various practices from prior religions Baha'u'llah has abolished. Now, we take these lessons and look forward. What was the future supposed to look like from 1892 up to today? How will we shape the future in Baha'u'llah's vision after today?

## BH11278 (The Book of My Testament After Me)

I want to introduce The Book of My Testament After Me, designated as BH11278. I am unsure exactly when it was written, but as Baha'u'llah Himself named it the "Testament After Me," I feel it would still be relevant at any point after Him.

The book is uncompromising in its nature of spiritual successorship. Authority passes through God to the Manifestation and is non-transferable. Baha'u'llah says "Can anyone share with Him in authority? Nay, by the Lord, though all may claim such for themselves." The true focal point of authority is the Book itself. No one may alter, interpret, or legislate apart from what God has revealed. He asks "Do you find any changer besides God or any interpreter apart from Him?"

Succession is about recognition, not an inheritance. This recognition is borne of belief and submission to the Divine command, even when the Manifestation is no longer among us. Spiritual legitamancy is measured by fidelity to the divine light. Baha'u'llah says "The Remnant of God in these days is the Manifestation of Light." Without this light, claims of authority are like shadows, they don't reflect the light in the mirror of their soul. It may have form, but it lacks substance.

Finally, BH11278 establishes a model of successorship where all authority after the Manifestation is custodial, conditional, and answerable to God alone. It is not absolute, it is not infallible, and it does not grant any rights to any leader unless explicitly granted by God.

## Endowments

Baha'u'llah says "no one is permitted to manage them except with permission of the Source of Revelation."[^spiritual-successorship-1] He continues by saying endowments is passed to the Aghsán, after them the institution of the House of Justice if it is established in the land. If not, endowments revert to the people of Baha. These endowments can only be used as specified in the Book. The specifications are for charitable purposes and in elevated places for the Cause.

[^spiritual-successorship-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #42

In BH08767, Baha'u'llah says all endowments revert to the Huquq'u'llah. Chapter 12.4 describes the various ways Baha'u'llah had utilized these endowments. This was reiterated by Baha'u'llah in BH00979.

Baha'u'llah begins the Kitab-i-Ahd (The Book of My Covenant) with a sermon regarding wealth. The Kitab-i-Ahd, which is reflects His Will and Trust says He did not leave treasures. "There is hidden fear and concealed danger in wealth... The wealth of the world is untrustworthy." Baha'u'llah adds specifically for the Aghsan that "God has not granted them any right to the property of others." Outside of collecting Huquq'u'llah as an endowment for charity and the Cause of God, the Aghsan had to still earn a living. They have no right to collect any additional property from anyone. They are not the Cause of God.

## Aghsán (The Branches of Baha'u'llah)

There are 2 collections of letters Baha'u'llah wrote which are unnamed. One is BH00023 which are letters to the Yazd community through Varqa, a well-respected follower in the time of Baha'u'llah. The other is BH00057, addressed to believers in Zanjan. Each has a portion which is entirely identical to each other, and both were written in 1881. They are explanations of certain parts of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and will be referenced regularly in this chapter.

With the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas and thereafter, Baha'u'llah would refer to branches which were not Himself or a Manifestation of God. Baha'u'llah defines the Aghsan as "the present branches." Among them are two Great Branches. After the present branches, souls are considered fruits and leaves. The branches are His sons. The Great Branches are the Ghusn-i-Azam (Abbas Effendi) which means Most Great Branch and then Ghusn-i-Akbar (Mirza Muhammad Ali) which means the Most Mighty Branch. Both are titles given by Baha'u'llah are relate to names of God. There were two other present branches, Ghusn-i-Anwar (Badi'u'llah) whose title means Luminous. There was also Diya'u'llah, who I am unable to locate a given Ghusn title. BH00017 (unnamed) does describe Diya as a Branch. Diya means Radiant. Another son, Ghusn-i-Athar (Mirza Mihdi) had passed away while in the prison in Akka in 1870. His title meant Pure.

For every son, there was either a title or name which related to a name of God. In Chapter 1, we described many of the names of God as well as potential dangers if we remove a name of God from our belief. I consider the entire tree of God, the Sundrat-ul-Muntaha, would bear the most fruits if all the branches were allowed to manifest these names of God fully.

In terms of endowments, after Baha'u'llah passed away, the Aghsán were responsible for endowments such as Huquq'u'llah. Baha'u'llah did not say one Branch, but all were responsible until the Houses of Justice are created. The Aghsán were to operate as a consultative body, where once again, consultation is guided by the Holy Spirit. They were to serve as trustees and examples of the future Houses of Justice. They were not to profit from these endowments. This did not happen. As one Branch tool sole responsibility of endowments, the Holy Spirit was not able to guide their use towards charity and the elevated places of God, such as Mashriq'ul-Adhkars, and the Sacred Houses in Shiraz and Baghdad.

After Ghusn-i-Akbar (Mirza Muhammad Ali) passed away, the Aghsán were no longer responsible for endowments. Until there are Houses of Justice, such as in your city, these endowments are to be managed by the people of Baha. The people of Baha are not to profit from them.

### Serving on the Throne

After the Kitab-i-Aqdas was written and Baha'u'llah and His followers gained more freedoms in the Akka and Haifa areas, He would receive believers as pilgrims and letters from across Persia and the Ottoman Empire. In the context of receiving believers, their news, requests, and giving decisions, support, and guidance, Baha'u'llah would refer to His place as the Sacred Throne with the Sacred Court.

The Aghsán served this Throne and Court. Abbas Effendi and Mirza Muhammad Ali during the entire period from 1873 - 1892. As Diya'u'llah and Badi'u'llah aged into maturity, they also served. The entire family was in support in various capacities. Unrelated followers, such as Mirza Aqa Jan, served as an amenuencis who recorded Baha'u'llah's words in His pen. For each Aghsán, I will provide an example of their service and another example of the praise Baha'u'llah gave them.

### In Honor of Abbas Effendi

In respect to his service:

> "O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory! The Most Great Branch hath presented thy letter and mentioned it before the face of the Wronged One. We have answered thee with that which no treasuries of utterance can equal, and when it was sent down, the necks of the just bowed before it."[^spiritual-successorship-2]

[^spiritual-successorship-2]: BH00314

In honor of his station:

> "He is the One Who speaks as He pleases
>
> O My Most Great Branch! Before the Wronged One has appeared thy letter, and We have heard that which thou didst commune with God, the Lord of the worlds. We have made thee a protection for all the worlds, and a guardian for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and a fortress for those who have believed in God, the One, the All-Knowing. We beseech God to protect them through thee, to enrich them through thee, to nourish them through thee, and to inspire thee with that which will make thee the Dawning-Place of wealth for all created things, the Ocean of bounty for all in the world, and the Dayspring of grace unto all peoples. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech Him to water through thee the earth and all that is therein, that there may grow from it the grass of wisdom and utterance, and the ears of knowledge and understanding. He, verily, is the Protector of whosoever turneth unto Him and the Helper of whosoever calleth upon Him. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Praised One."[^spiritual-successorship-3]

[^spiritual-successorship-3]: BH09144

### In Honor of Mirza Muhammad Ali

In respect to his service:

> "O Jamalu’d-Din! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the True, the Manifest King. The letters which thou didst send were presented before the Most Holy Court by the Greater Branch. We beseech God to assist thee, to confirm thee, and to aid thee in that which will draw thee closer to Him in all conditions, and to exalt through thee His mention among His servants. In these days certain passages have been revealed under the name of “Traveler” - there would be no harm if they were sent to European lands."[^spiritual-successorship-4]

[^spiritual-successorship-4]: BH07364

In honor of his station:

> "Blessed is he who seeketh shelter beneath the shade of the Branch of God, his Lord and the Lord of the Throne and the Lord of all the worlds. O My Branch! Be thou as the spring cloud of My loving-kindness, then shower upon all things in My wondrous Name. O My Branch! We have chosen thee by virtue of Him Who is the Chosen One choosing thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds! O Greater Branch! We have chosen thee for the triumph of My Cause. Arise to achieve a wondrous triumph. Subdue the cities of names through My Name, the Sovereign over all that He willeth. O thou Ocean! Surge by My Name, the All-Compelling, the Most Great. Open thou the cities of hearts through My Name, the Best-Beloved, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Every deed hath been made dependent upon thy love. Blessed is he who hath attained unto that which his Lord, the All-Knowing, hath willed. Blessed is he who hath heard thy call and turned to thee out of love for God, the Lord of the worlds."[^spiritual-successorship-5]

Verily the Kingdom of Utterance hath turned toward you and made mention of you in such wise that all mention in the world hath bowed low at its revelation, that ye might rejoice and be numbered among the thankful. His honor Diya, one of My Branches, hath presented your letter and made mention of you before Our presence."[^spiritual-successorship-6]

We hope through God’s grace that He will soon grant nearness and reunion. We long to see and yearn to speak with the Spirit of Life, Ziya’u’r-Rahman, that we may hear sweet words from those sugar-sweet lips in Samarkand. We remember Badi’u’llah with our tongue, seek him with our heart, and yearn for him with our soul. May my soul be sacrificed for thy nearness and thy words, O Badi’."[^spiritual-successorship-9]

[^spiritual-successorship-9]: BH10221

## Answering Questions About the Book

Baha'u'llah instructs us to "refer what you do not understand from the Book to the Branch that has branched forth from this mighty Root."[^spiritual-successorship-10] He further explains this in the letters to Yazd and Zanjan. He says the Book refers to the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Branch that has branched forth from this mighty Root refers to the Aghsán.

[^spiritual-successorship-10]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #174

This is an extremely specific responsibility for the Aghsán as a consultative body. As we have learned throughout this book, Baha'u'llah repeatedly nurtures this sense of self-discovery, these opportunities to immerse yourself within God's consciousness on your own terms. This is your experience. This is your soul. This is your free-will. Liberation is your right, and liberation is the responsibility we have to ourselves and others. With this said, let's look closely at this verse.

Baha'u'llah starts the counsel with a conditional statement. "Refer what you do not understand." Baha'u'llah invites us in paragraph #53 to refer what is revealed from Him. We have a responsibility to attempt understanding through the spiritual practices of recitation, reflection, and where possible, actions which embody these teachings. Sometimes understanding unfolds over time as we pass through the spiritual worlds. Sometimes we feel stuck on an idea. To refer what we do not understand does not absolve our responsibility to attempt understanding on our own. We refer only once we have tried.

The second phrase says "from the Book." This phrase purposefully narrows the scope even further. In BH00023 and BH00057, the Book is explicitly defined as the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Kitab-i-Aqdas only. This means we refer only what we do not understand of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. This does not include any other book or writing.

As it appears, the Aghsán were to consult together where any particular believer attempted to understand the Kitab-i-Aqdas but were unable to. The result of this consultation would be guided by the Holy Spirit. Baha'u'llah did not express any teaching the understanding of the Aghsan would replace other believer's understandings. The consultation was for the individual who did not understand, completely within the context of what they asked and understood already. I envision the Aghsán's role to be like that of scholars Baha'u'llah commanded us to turn to. While guided by the Holy Spirit, it may not encompass the entirety of the Most Great Ocean. This consultation would be incredibly valuable for the community.

Again, this did not happen.

## The Branch to Turn Towards

The last part of the Kitab-i-Aqdas which describes spiritual successorship is from the paragraph 121.\
"When the sea of reunion is stilled, and the Book of Origin reaches its end, turn towards Him whom God has willed, the one who branched from this ancient Root." The letters to Yazd and Zanjan also explain this. Baha'u'llah responds clearly to the inquiry:

> "The divine intention refers to His Holiness, the Most Great Branch, and after him, His Holiness, the Most Mighty Branch. My spirit, essence, and being are a sacrifice for the dust of their feet."

Baha'u'llah bestows great honor upon Abbas Effendi and Mirza Muhammad Ali. Baha'u'llah used the phrase "turn towards." I understand this as Abbas Effendi has a responsibility, but he is not given any particular rights. While holding a high station, Baha'u'llah's leadership model does not change. Throughout the book, we describe how Baha'u'llah taught trusteeship in every level of society. Parents and monarchs and every level in between are to lead as trustees over that which they are entrusted to.

The Aghsán still exist to manage endowments and to explain what is not understood from the Kitab-i-Aqdas. I understand Abbas Effendi's role to be custodial, much as Mirza Yahya's was to be. Baha'u'llah from 1873 until His passing in 1892 strove to teach the Kitab-i-Aqdas, show love towards His family and kinsmen (all believers), and nurture the liberation of souls in an environment which was quite oppressive. The Aghsán were to be an example of the consultation all were capable of, if they believed.

None of the Branches had the authority to deprive any person of their rights, to deny anyone of their responsibilities, nor to change the law of Baha'u'llah. Again, this did not happen.

## The Kitab-i-Ahd (The Book of My Covenant)

After Baha'u'llah passed away, this document was read and shared with the community. We shared the very first teaching within it regarding wealth. Baha'u'llah teaches the purpose of His revelation was "to extinguish the flames of malice and hatred, so that the horizons of the hearts of the people of the world may be illuminated with the light of unity and attain true tranquility." He promises our human station is great. He reminds us to hold firm to the Divine Command.

Baha'ullah describes all religion to be for love and unity. Strife and contention are forbidden. He offers blessings for those who lead, especially those who believe in the Divine Command. He purpose is for the Kitab-i-Aqdas to shine radiantly and rise in the horizon. He warns us not to make the Cause of God a tool for disorder and division. We are to say "All are from God."

Baha'u'llah reiterates His explanations from the letters to Zanjan and Yazd. He says "We have chosen the Most Mighty Branch after the Most Great Branch as a matter from the All-Knowing, the All-Aware." He counsels love for the branches is incumbent upon everyone, without exceptions. He later says respect and regard for the branches are required, as well as for the entire family of Baha'u'llah, the Afnán (the Bab's family). Finally, all are counseled to serve the nations and reform the world. I want to clearly state one thing about the family. In the letters which have been mostly been unavailable to the People of Baha, the Sacred Family is honored repeatedly for their service and devotion to the Cause of God. Their respect and love is well-earned.

Sadly, these things in the Kitab-i-Ahd did not happen.

### The Testament Requires Trusteeship

The Kitab-i-Ahd and BH11278 were both testaments from Baha'u'llah. Abbas Effendi was entrusted to execute the final testament of Baha'u'llah. He was to witness, to be a trustee, and to help. Nothing more and nothing less. It was an incredible honor and reflection of the high hopes Baha'u'llah had for his eldest son. It was also a difficult position to be in. I will not explain further, but I can only say Baha'u'llah's final testament was not fulfilled. God's All-Knowing nature, while aware of all the probabilities any outcome could have, knew there was a chance of success and a chance of failure. I feel the greatest failure stemmed from self-exaltation and the proceeding inability to consult. Remember, if consultation is guided by the Holy Spirit, what is guiding authoritarian rule?

I want to close this section on the Aghsn with an excerpt from the Tablet of Khalil, written sometime when Baha'u'llah was in Edirne. When asked about His sons (who are not called Branches yet), He says:

> As for what you asked about my son, know that if my sons follow God’s laws and do not exceed what has been specified in God’s book, the prevailing, the Ever-Existing, and they command themselves and the servants to do good, and they forbid evil, and they testify to what God has testified in His decisive verses, the conclusive, the definitive, and they believe in whoever God reveals on the day in which the times of the former and the latter are counted, and on it, everyone presents themselves to their Lord, and they will not disagree on God’s command and will not stray from His ordained, written law. Then know that they are leaves of the tree of monotheism and its fruits, and with them, the clouds rain and the clouds lift with grace if you truly believe. They are God’s household among you and His family in your midst, and His mercy upon the worlds if you know. From them, the breeze of God blows on you, and the winds of dignity and love pass over those close. They are God’s pen, His command, and His word among His creatures, and with them, He takes and gives if you understand. Through them, the earth has shone with the light of your Lord, and the signs of His grace have appeared to those who do not deny God’s signs. However, those who hurt them have hurt me, and those who hurt me have deviated from God’s path, the prevailing, the Ever-Existing. So, you will find the deviation of the deviators and their arrogance towards us and their transgression against ourselves without clear evidence or a preserved book.
>
> Say, O people, they are God’s signs among you, beware of arguing with them, or killing them, or be among those who oppress and do not realize. They are God’s secret on earth and returned under the hands of the oppressors on this earth that fell behind the elevated mountains. All of that was returned to them at the time when they were young in the kingdom, and they had no sin but in the path of God, the Capable, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved, and those from them who appear naturally and God runs from their tongues signs of His power, and he is among those God has chosen for His command. There is no god but He, to Him belongs creation and command, and we are all commanded by His command. We ask God to make them successful in obeying Him and to provide them with what pleases their hearts and the hearts of those who inherit Paradise from God, the Mighty, the Prevailing, the Ever-Existing.

It seems the sons were our greatest test.

## The Path Forward

While the Aghsán were unable to fulfill their purpose, we still have a path to move on. Baha'u'llah taught after the Aghsán, if the Houses of Justice are not yet established, the People of Baha are the spiritual successors. As you read this, you might be a Person of Baha. I invite you to this path forward.

There are many roles we may take on as trustees. We can serve as scholars, we can organize remembrance services and the melodious recitation of the verses of God, we can promote our Holy Days and festivals, and we can nurture each other's path. We can manage endowments for the needy, and strive for the elevated places of the Cause. The possibilities are endless as long as you believe.

I believe this all starts with honoring not only the Kitab-i-Aqdas, but also Baha'u'llah's Testaments. If you hold any malice towards any of Baha'u'llah's family, let it go. It is in the past. Pray for their spiritual well-being and union with God. If you hold onto any notions of infallibility, let it go. Infallibility is reserved for the next Manifestation of God which will exist no earlier than 1,000 years after Baha'u'llah, and no later than the Bab's concept of Mustagith (about 1,500 years). Today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow.

The next chapter will focus in on Trusteeship Governance, where we put the various concepts of Part 4 together. This is a path we can all walk on together in the name of Baha, and in honor of His ministry.
