## Worship in the Houses of the Lord

### Congregational

Congregational worship, also described as the remembrance of the Lord, is encouraged. See the section of the "Houses in the Name of the Lord" regarding their function and purpose.

### Private / Personal

Blessed is the one who turns towards the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár.

Sit in silence, listening to the verses of God.

## Pilgrimage

Men are to perform pilgrimage to the Sacred House. The House is defined as the house where Baha'u'llah lived in Bahji, at Acre. The men are to be able-bodied and have the means to do so. If a man is not able to, it will not be held against him. Women are not required to, but are also allowed to if they so choose.

This difference in ruling is not about gender inequality, or saying women are less able to perform pilgrimage. This is about women having less of an obligation in God's eyes to perform a task. This is about mercy and generosity.

## Engaging in an Occupation

Engaging in an occupation is an act of worship. The purpose is to engage in activities that benefit yourself and others. This requires trusting in God, who is the provider.

Notice the purpose of the occupation is not necessarily to become wealthy, although wealth is one mode to benefit yourself and others. The goal is to find a way to benefit others and trust in God to provide.
