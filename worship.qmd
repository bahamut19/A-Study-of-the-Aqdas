## Worship in the Houses of the Lord

Congregational worship, also described as the remembrance of the Lord, is encouraged. See the section of the "Houses in the Name of the Lord" regarding their function and purpose.

## Pilgrimage

Men are to perform pilgrimage to the House. The House is defined as the house where Baha'u'llah lived in Bahji, at Acre. The men are to be able-bodied and have the means to do so. If a man is not able to, it will not be held against him. Women are not required to, but are also allowed to if they so choose.

This difference in ruling is not about gender inequality, or saying women are less able to perform pilgrimage. This is about women having less of an obligation in God's eyes to perform a task. This is about mercy and generosity.
