title: "Prayer"
---

Prayer is the first spiritual practice this book present. Baha'u'llah dedicated a large part of the Kitab-i-Aqdas towards prayer. This chapter will describe what the Book discusses regarding prayer and some emergent virtues which are cultivated by the spiritual practice of prayer. There is obligatory prayer, which is a required daily practice. There is also non-obligatory prayer, which is personal prayer whenever you feel the need or desire to communicate with God. The end of this chapter will use one of the obligatory prayers to describe some of the ways prayer could be expressed.

## Who is Required to Pray

The age of maturity is the age when a believer is first required to pray, as well as other religious duties such as fasting.[^obligatory-prayer-1] The age of maturity will be discussed more in depth in Chapter 21, but the age is not a specific universal number. Age in this case is more similar to a life stage which has certain prerequisites. If one has not reached this period, they are not required to pray but may if they so desire.

[^obligatory-prayer-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #10

Prayer is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to. There is no requirement for a medical professional to determine if an illness qualifies for prayer exemption, nor to determine if a person has reached old age. Once again, no definitive universal number was described. I feel this is also more of a stage of life which is determined by certain prerequisites.

A woman who is menstrating does not have to perform obligatory prayer nor fast[^obligatory-prayer-2]. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase "Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty" 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon. This repetition does not need to be done all at once, and there is no particular method described. How she performs this spiritual task is entirely up to her. This exclusion is not due to her being impure, but more of a mercy. As the medium and long prayers include the physical acts of prostration, the pain associated with prostrating might be distracting. I don't believe God wants us to be unduly troubled during prayer. The act of remembrance, covered more deeply in Chapter 9, is also equally important as prayer. I hope a person would not feel a woman is spiritually weaker for praying less than is required of a man and find remembrance to be as vital to the soul as prayer is.

[^obligatory-prayer-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #13

## Preparation for Obligatory Prayer

Ablutions are required in preparation for obligatory prayer.[^obligatory-prayer-3] An ablution is the washing of your hands and face with water. If ablutions cannot be performed, the short prayer should be offered to God prior to the obligatory prayer "In the Name of God, the Purest, the Purest" five times. The purpose of ablution is a ritualistic way to symbolize purifying yourself prior to prayer. While ablutions is an outer form of purifying, one must not neglect the aspects of purifying inwardly. There are no hard rules, but I feel part of the purpose of the obligatory prayer is to purify. The Salat-i-Kabir (Great Obligatory Prayer) is a great example.

[^obligatory-prayer-3]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #18

There are no other preparations described. However, the prayer is meant to be an individual act with the requirement of congregational prayer being lifted.[^obligatory-prayer-4] This does not mean congregational prayer is prohibited, but no individual should be expected to do so. There should be no pressure to pray with others.

[^obligatory-prayer-4]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #12

For personal prayer, ablutions do not need to be performed although you could if you want to.

## Length of Prayer

The length of the obligatory prayer was to consist of nine rak'ahs. A rak'ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha'u'llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.

For individual, non-obligatory prayer the length does not matter. I feel the obligatory prayer, while designed to stand alone without other prayers, can be a great way to lead into personal prayer. Personal prayer is where you say what is within your heart to God. The obligatory prayer can help set the stage in establishing sincerity, detachment, and other spiritual qualities. Still, pray whenever you feel like it.

## Time of Day

The obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.

The small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.

For believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable.[^obligatory-prayer-5] For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.

[^obligatory-prayer-5]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #10

Depending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha'u'llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.

As God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.

No matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.

## Direction of Prayer

The direction of obligatory prayer is called the Qiblih, or the point of adoration. As the point is currently the point where the Sun of Truth and Explanation had set, this would be the mansion of Bahji in present day Acre, Israel.

Even though we are to turn to where Baha'u'llah was last manifested in the flesh, it does not mean we are praying to Baha'u'llah or worshiping Him. We are still praying to God. The purpose for praying towards Baha'u'llah is due to His role as the Manifestation of God. Baha'u'llah is directly branched from the Sundrat'ul-Muntaha and reflects the names and attributes of God. If we turn our souls towards Baha'u'llah, it helps our souls to also reflect these names and attributes as mirrors. Say, in one example, we turn to the Qiblih and by doing so, we turn to God's name All-Bountiful. Simultaneously, we are also turning away from the symbols of wealth which might exist elsewhere near us, such as a luxurious building, gold jewelry, or a TV promoting consumerism. We eliminate potential idols each time we turn to God through the practice of facing the Qiblih. It truly is the point of adoration.

Although we are mirrors and prayer helps us reflect the names and attributes of God, we must not be thinking of any particular name or attribute of God during prayer. The Bab says this in the Persian Bayan "The worshiper, during prayer, should see none but their Beloved and focus solely on God, One without Partner. If they bring to mind any name or attribute in their worship, they become veiled, and their worship is not accepted."[^obligatory-prayer-6]

[^obligatory-prayer-6]: The Persian Bayan, Vahid 9 Gate 19

Today, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don't have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect. For prayers which are not obligatory, a believer can face in any direction. God is in all directions.

As a simple sidenote, Acre is one of the world's longest continuously lived settlements, going back to the Bronze Age. It also served as the final stronghold for Christian Crusaders before they were defeated by the Mamluks. Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.

## The Prayer for the Dead

The prayer for the dead provides for two options. The first option is to recite the full prayer revealed. There is a version for the male deceased and another for the female deceased. The second option exists if the believer has not remembered the full prayer. This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar (God is Great) six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.

The Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.

The person should be buried with spirit and fragrance.

## No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing

A person can wear their hair as they wish.[^obligatory-prayer-7] Baha'u'llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha'u'llah states these rules were not in the Qur'an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish. The clothes worn for prayer must be clean, in keeping with the idea of being purified through ablutions.

[^obligatory-prayer-7]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #9

I believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha'u'llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and the liberation of the soul. Prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.

A female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.

Baha'u'llah does regularly use garments as a symbol of our character. An example is in a letter to Ali-Akbar, where Baha'u'llah hopes all the friends of God may be adorned with the garment of sanctity.[^obligatory-prayer-8] The garment is what others is supposed to see from us. In this example, people who are or who are not Baha'i is will be able to easily see a Baha'i is holy and inviolable in their belief and conduct. Perhaps saintly. This outer garment is more important than the actual garment, and this outer garment is portrayed through good deeds and morals. It is not portrayed through words or wishful thinking.

[^obligatory-prayer-8]: BH00010: Letters to Tehran Through Ali-Akbar

## Clean Flooring

For prostration, Baha'u'llah allows for any clean surface. This does mean the surface must be clean. A person may use a clean prayer rug, but a prayer rug is not required. You could be on an old wooden flooring and it is acceptable if it is clean. You could be on the finest marble and it is acceptable if it is clean. Once again, the idea is for prayer to be accessible and focused on the spirit, not the material.

## In Times of Exceptional Natural Phenomena

The Bab had outlined a specific prayer for the signs, or natural phenomena. Baha'u'llah has abrogated this and says we only need to say, ""Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds."

The verse is a great reminder in times of fear and distress. Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.

## During Travel

During travel, obligatory prayer may be replaced while taking rest. The first option is to do a single prostration on a clean surface and recite "Glory be to God, the Lord of Grandeur and Majesty, of Bounty and Grace." If one is unable to find a clean surface or is unable to prostrate for any reason, the second option is to say "Glory be to God."

After the prostration, sit in the position of unity. I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say "Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty" 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.

It should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer. This can, at a minimum, take just a minute although the length can vary depending on how you recite the prayer.

## Emergent Virtues

I want to close this chapter with a brief introduction to a few emergent virtues. These virtues are born from the innate virtue piety and can be developed through the practice of prayer, although not exclusively through prayer. I believe prayer is a great way to develop and express piety.

### Detachment

> Abandon what you possess and soar with the wings of detachment above the realm of creation.[^obligatory-prayer-9]

[^obligatory-prayer-9]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #54

Rooted in the innate virtue of piety, detachment arises when the soul turns its gaze from the world to the divine. Prayer invites the soul to release its grip on the transient, anchoring itself instead in the eternal. In the quiet moment of turning to God, the heart loosens its hold on worldly ambitions, fears, and desires. This daily act of reorientation weakens the illusion that material things possess lasting authority. By facing the Qiblih, one is not just turning toward a physical direction, but symbolically turning away from all other directions—detaching from every voice except the voice of God. Over time, this consistent detachment makes the soul freer, clearer, and more faithful to the unseen.

### Humility

> Return to Him, humbled, submissive, and lowly, for He will forgive your misdeeds. Your Lord is indeed the Oft-Forgiving, the Almighty, the Merciful.[^obligatory-prayer-10]

[^obligatory-prayer-10]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #184

The humility that blossoms in prayer is the natural fruit of piety’s inward reverence. True prayer is not performed from a station of pride, but from the recognition of utter dependence. When the worshiper stands before God, all claims to self-sufficiency are stripped away. The body bows; the tongue confesses. There is no pretense in the sincere prayer of a seeker. Through this repeated posture of submission, humility takes root—not as weakness, but as spiritual clarity. The one who prays recognizes that every good comes from beyond, and every virtue is sustained by grace.

### Lowliness

> O Son of Spirit! I created you lofty, yet you have made yourself lowly. Ascend to what you were created for.[^obligatory-prayer-11]

[^obligatory-prayer-11]: The Hidden Words in Arabic #22

Piety teaches the soul to rejoice in lowliness, knowing that nearness to God requires the annihilation of self. Closely related to humility, lowliness is the virtue of embracing one’s smallness before the majesty of God. In prayer, the worshiper does not merely acknowledge imperfection, but consciously descends into a state of lowliness to rise spiritually. Bahá’u’lláh often prays from a place of utter abasement, saying, “I am the most lowly servant at Thy threshold.” This condition is not self-contempt but the recognition that the soul is nothing without God. Through the rhythm of prayer, the soul learns to take joy in this smallness, for it becomes the vessel through which divine light pours forth.

### Reverence

> To Him ascends the good word, and all faces prostrate before Him, and all who are in the heavens and the earth worship Him. There is nothing, but it glorifies Him with praise and fears from His reverence, there is no god but He, the Mighty, the Eternal.[^obligatory-prayer-12]

[^obligatory-prayer-12]: Lawh-i-Madinatut-Tawhid (Tablet of the City of Unity)

Reverence is the emotional shape of piety—an inward trembling in the presence of the sacred. Prayer awakens this sense of awe—an awareness that one is standing before the Most High. Reverence is not simply about solemnity, but about approaching the divine with love and fear in equal measure. Through prayer, especially in its prescribed forms, the soul learns the etiquette of approach: washing before entering the divine presence, facing the Qiblih, reciting words with care. These gestures, repeated daily, form a spiritual discipline that trains the soul in reverence. In time, this posture flows beyond prayer into every aspect of life.

### Thankfulness

> All the bounty is in Our hand, and We give it to whom We wish from Our near servants. Thus, We have favored you time after time so that you may thank your Lord with a thankfulness that opens the possible worlds to thank Our merciful, compassionate Self.[^obligatory-prayer-13]

[^obligatory-prayer-13]: Suriy-i-Haykal (Surah of the Temple)

Thankfulness flows from piety's deep recognition of God as the Source of all that is. Every prayer is, in essence, a return to the Giver. Whether petitioning, praising, or weeping in longing, the soul is always brought back to the remembrance of what has been given. Thankfulness grows in the soil of this awareness. Even in hardship, prayer allows the soul to perceive mercy beneath trial and wisdom within pain. In turning to God again and again, one cannot help but begin to notice the countless, quiet gifts that fill each moment. Thus, prayer transforms the heart—not only into one that asks, but one that overflows with gratitude.

### The Example of Baha'u'llah

The writings of Baha'u'llah are full of examples of Him praying to God as a servant. In this condition, Baha'u'llah is showing us the framework of how prayer can be. We do not necessarily have to say exactly what Baha'u'llah would say, as most of these prayers were for the time, space, and context of the particular moment the prayer was revealed. We can see what Baha'u'llah prayed for, to whom, and maybe see if God answered these prayers and if so, in what way. We must always remember that while Baha'u'llah was a Manifestation of God, Baha'u'llah was still human. I interpret this human condition as He was not omniscient or omnipresent, but had capacities to serve a specific mission God had ordained for Him. When Baha'u'llah was praying to God, this was not necessarily revelation as God would not pray to God. It is important to be mindful of Baha'u'llah's human condition and not to confuse Him as God.

With that said, the answering of prayers is entirely up to God. The purpose of prayer is not for wishes to be granted, but for the will of us to merge with that of the will of God. Often Baha'u'llah would pray that a person would attain certain spiritual qualities or be assisted in doing so. I believe God would always provide this assistance. Yet, it is still up to the individual person to choose to embody those qualities. This means if Baha'u'llah prayed for a person, or prayed for the qualities and assistance of a person, it does not automatically mean this person attained that quality or station.

This is why emergent virtues such as detachment, humility, lowliness, reverence, and thankfulness are all vital to the practice of prayer. No matter what the outcome, whether we recognize it or not, and whether another person reflects our wish or not, we must always be thankful for the assistance, mercy, and bounty God does provide us. We should do our best to pray like Baha'u'llah did, according to the time, space, and context of our individual and unique lives. This practice will help the innate piety which exists within us to further emerge and express itself more fully within our lives.

This is one of the pathways to liberate our souls, just as Baha'u'llah's soul was liberated.

## Congregational Prayer

While congregational prayer is not a part of the obligatory prayer, it is a part of the spiritual practice of the Mashriq-ul-Adhkar. There is a delicate balance to praying together, but not to pray merely to be seen and appear pious. There is another delicate balance in being free to still pray as you feel compelled to do so while not requiring a rigid tradition of there being specific prayers or rituals in a congregation. For example, we should be careful that people only ask for healing prayers. Prayers must only come from a place of liberation and true expressions of the soul. If a particular day there is no congregational prayer, it is also acceptable and does not reflect on the community negatively. It could be on this day, the believers desire only to pray privately. Once again, the emergent virtues could be expressed in many different ways. Detachment from ritual is vital, as is detachment from expectation of others.

Each unique soul has its own spiritual capacity in any given moment. Congregational prayer should only serve the purpose of uplifting each other's souls, not as any litmus test of the progress of another. Humility should help prevent such outcomes. All prayer is in reverence for the Beloved, not ourselves, not our institutions, and not our traditions. All is from God and all is for God. We are all equally lowly before Him. To Him we should be thankful, and thankful for the opportunity to share our beliefs and worship with others.
