## Melodious Tones

And those who recite the verses of the Most Merciful with the most melodious tones, they perceive from them that which no dominion of the heavens and the earth can equal, and through them they discover the fragrance of My worlds, which today are known only to those endowed with vision from this exalted station. Say, it draws pure hearts to spiritual worlds that cannot be expressed by words nor pointed to by signs. Blessed are those who listen.

## Spiritual Worlds

## The Preserved Tablet can reckon

## Heaven

## Heaven of Revelation

## Heaven of Grandeur and Might

We have desired in the realm of power only the remembrance of God and what has been revealed from Him, and sufficient is God as My helper.

Realm of Power

## The Mother Book

## Greater World

The Kingdom

We have desired in the kingdom only the exaltation of the Cause of God and His praise, and sufficient is God as My trustee.

## The Lesser World

Dominion

We have desired in the dominion only the appearance of God and His sovereignty, and sufficient is God as My witness.

## Kingdom of Your Lord

School of God

Were We to speak in this station with the tongue of the dwellers of the Kingdom, We would say that God created that School before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and We entered it before the Káf was joined with its supporting Nún.

This is the language of **My servants in My Kingdom**. Reflect upon what is uttered by the tongue of those in My Dominion of Power, with what We have taught them of knowledge from Our presence, and of what was hidden in the knowledge of God. And reflect upon what is spoken by the Tongue of Grandeur and Might in its praiseworthy station.

## Kingdom of Names

Cities of Names have submitted to God's Cause.

## Kingdom of Command

## The Throne

## The Sidrat al-Muntaha

aka the Divine Lote-Tree of the farthest limit

call on the lofty Mount upon the holy land: The sovereignty belongs to God, the Almighty, the Beloved. (in regards to the revelation)

Lote-Tree recites to you of the verses of God
