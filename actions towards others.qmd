## Violent Acts

### Murder

Murder is prohibited. This is the first clear prohibition in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. In the West, there are different definitions for homicide and murder, along with defining intention. In the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah uses the Arabic word "al-qatl" (القتل), where upon the various types of murder add onto the base word qatl.

This means any loss of human life by another human is prohibited, whether intended or not. The impact of any loss of life by another person is too great. It weakens the fabric of the community, causes trauma, distrust, and potentially thoughts and feelings which can betray which God desires for us.

In another sense, it is an act of shirk, the Arabic concept of joining partners with God. Ultimately God has all power of creation, but murder is where a person tries to take this power away from God. The person is deciding when another's spiritual journey will begin the next stage.

## Sexual Acts

### Adultery

Adultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.

There are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.

## Social Acts

### Backbiting

Backbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.

Additionally, Baha'u'llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say "I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?" The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.

The backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.

Now, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.

Finally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha'u'llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?

### Slander

Slander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another's reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.

## Seeking Forgiveness From Others

Baha'u'llah forbids anyone to seek forgiveness from another as a religious duty. Only God can grant forgiveness if you repent from a sin.

This command also helps assure there is no hierarchy among the people of the community. This keeps one from exalting themselves over you, and also assures another does not place you in a position above them. We are all equals, born with a noble soul.
