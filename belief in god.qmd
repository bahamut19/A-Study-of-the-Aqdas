## The Lord of all Religions

The Kitab-i-Aqdas's first five verses set the table for the foundation of faith. The first foundation is a belief in God, who is the Lord of all Religions.

The first question a person could have would be what qualifies as a religion? So far in the writings of Baha'u'llah, there is nothing in particular which qualifies what makes a religion true or false. There are exhortations saying some scriptures are true, but Baha'u'llah does not say other religions who do not have a scripture are not true. Scriptures does not equal religion as many religions exist without formal scripture.

Baha'u'llah does refer to the practices of various faiths in the surrounding areas, such as ascetic practices of Hinduism.

Religion is any faith-based practice which has some kind of ritual, tradition, mode of worship, and a belief in at least one diety. The word "all" is the most inclusive word one can use. If a person were to ask "Is God the Lord of so-and-so religion?" the answer should always be "yes."

The Kitab-i-Ahd reminds the people to always remember "All is from God." This phrase is the very foundation of belief. All is from God. It is also the foundation of unity. With God being One, All is also One, even when there are differing attributes and qualities being expressed and observed. Even in polytheistic traditions, all is from God. If a religion has a practice which is different from another religion, all is from God.
