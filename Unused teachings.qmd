## The Preserved Tablet (Lawh-i-Mahfuz)

## God Loves the Patient

## God Loves Unity and Concord

## God Abhors Separation and Divorce

## By Whom Earthquakes Appeared

## By Whom Tribes Lamented

Except for those who cast aside the world and took what was commanded in the Hidden Tablet.

He who does not recite has not fulfilled the covenant of God and His testament, and whoever turns away from it today is among those who turned away from God in the eternity of eternities.

By Him (Baha'u'llah) the Hour has come

## Seeking Forgiveness

A believer is only allowed to seek forgiveness from God, not from any other person as a religious act. Repentance is only to be sought for by yourself and with God only. Also associated with this act of worship is the prohibition from kissing the hands of another person in an attempt to seek forgiveness.

No person can determine if you are saved, condemned, or any other form of divine judgment. God is Mighty and Forgiving. There are no exclusions based on any act, any perspective, or the like. The Aqdas does say the first command is about believing, which without belief makes you in error no matter what good deed you do. Without belief, you wouldn't even seek forgiveness from God. From who then, would grant you heaven?
