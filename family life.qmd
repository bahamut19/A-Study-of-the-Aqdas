## Treating Kindred

Show love and kindness to your kindred.

None have a right to the wealth of the people. Mention inheritance.

## Marriage

Marriage is enjoined upon us. Enjoined is an authoritative instruction or directive which implies it is either required or highly encouraged. The same word is used regarding prayer and fasting, which is usually interpreted to mean as they are required, pending acceptable exceptions.

### Purpose of Marriage

The purpose of marriage is to have at least one child, a child who will remember God.

### Monogamy or Bigamy

The man is allowed up to two wives. More than two wives is not allowed. The man who is content with one wife with ensure both of their tranquility. This implies there can be complicating issues with polygamy. The first ones I can think of could be jealousy or a fear from the wife that perhaps she is not good enough to completely satisfy her husband. Insecurity definitely impacts tranquility. This means monogamy is preferred, although it is not required.

There is no rule which explicitly expresses a limitation on the number of husbands she can have. However, in regards to the teachings Baha'u'llah offers in his letters to Shiraz, he unequivacally states women are equal to men. Perhaps then, this is also applies to marriage law although there is no evidence a Baha'i woman ever married two men in the time of Baha'u'llah. This could merely be a function of Baha'is being subjected to Islamic law, which had a clear prohibition of female polygamy.

### Virginity

The husband is allowed to choose a virgin, but it is not a requirement. The implication of this verse is there is no punishment for the woman if she is not a virgin.

### Oppression and Lewdness

## Having a Child

As marriage is enjoined upon the believers, and the purpose of marriage is to have a child, having a child is also enjoined upon the believers.

## Children's Education

Fathers are enjoined to education their children. If they fail in this act, the House of Justice must act. This education must include writing and whatever has been prescribed in the Tablet. Educating a child is viewed as educating one of Baha'u'llah's own children. He provides His glory, loving-kindness, and mercy to fathers.

Education must also include learning. Learning could refer to specific subjects, or it could refer to the skills needed to enable a thorough education. Skills could include reading, mathematics, curiosity, critical thinking, problem solving, studying, adaptability, values, and principles.
