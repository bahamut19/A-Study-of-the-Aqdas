## Children's Education

Fathers are responsible for the education of their children. If they fail in this act, the House of Justice must act. This education must include writing and whatever has been prescribed in the Tablet. Educating a child is viewed as educating one of Baha'u'llah's own children. He provides His glory, loving-kindness, and mercy to fathers.

Education must also include learning. Learning could refer to specific subjects, or it could refer to the skills needed to enable a thorough education. Skills could include reading, mathematics, curiosity, critical thinking, problem solving, studying, adaptability, values, and principles.
