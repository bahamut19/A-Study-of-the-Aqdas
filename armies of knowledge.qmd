## Banners of Expression

The tribes of religion were vanquished, except for those who drink from the Kawthar of life

## To the Concourse of the Bayan

The Primal Point had declared the exaltation of the Cause of Baha'u'llah over His own Cause.

We entered the School of God while you were asleep,

We observed the Tablet while you were heedless.

By the True One, We read it before its descent, while you were unaware.

We encompassed the Book while you were still in the loins.

This is My mention according to your capacity, not according to the measure of God. This is attested by what is in the knowledge of God, if only you knew, and by the Tongue of God, if only you understood. By God, were the veil to be lifted, you would be thunderstruck.

Beware of disputing about God and His Cause. Verily, He has appeared in a manner that encompasses all that was and all that will be.

Were We to speak in this station with the tongue of the dwellers of the Kingdom, We would say that God created that School before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and We entered it before the Káf was joined with its supporting Nún.

This is the language of My servants in My Kingdom. Reflect upon what is uttered by the tongue of those in My Dominion of Power, with what We have taught them of knowledge from Our presence, and of what was hidden in the knowledge of God. And reflect upon what is spoken by the Tongue of Grandeur and Might in its praiseworthy station.

This is not an affair to be toyed with by your fancies, nor is this a station into which every timid and deluded soul may enter.

By God, this is the arena of unveiling and detachment, the field of vision and exaltation.

None traverse it except the knights of the All-Merciful, who have cast aside all that is created.

These are the helpers of God on earth and the dawning places of might among the worlds.

Beware lest what is in the Bayán keeps you from your Lord, the All-Merciful. By God, it was revealed for My remembrance, if only you knew.

The sincere find in it only the fragrance of My love and My name, the One who prevails over all that is seen and unseen.

Say: O people, turn toward what has been revealed from My Most High Pen. If you find therein the fragrance of God, do not object to it, and do not withhold yourselves from the grace and bounties of God. Thus does God counsel you; verily, He is the Wise Counselor.

What you do not understand from the Bayán, ask God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. Verily, if He wills, He can make clear to you what was revealed therein and what was hidden in the ocean of its words of pearls of knowledge and wisdom. Truly, He is the One who prevails over the names; there is no God but Him, the All-Subduing.
