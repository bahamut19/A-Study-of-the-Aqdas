## Banners of Expression

The tribes of religion were vanquished, except for those who drink from the Kawthar of life

## Clinging to Another Branch

Baha'u'llah tells the Emperor of Austria he was clinging to the branch, but was heedless of the root. Because of this, he did not recognize Baha'u'llah.

## Prior Revelation from God

Beware that you allow what has been revealed in the former Book from recognizing there is no God but God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.

No one should hold to anything today except that which has appeared in this Revelation. This is the command of God, before and after, and with it He has adorned the scriptures of former generations. This is the mention of God, before and after, with which He has embroidered the fabric of the Book of Existence, if you are of those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after. Beware lest you be of the abased. Nothing can avail you today, and no one has any refuge but God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whoever has known Me has known the intended purpose; whoever has turned to Me has turned to the Worshiped One. Thus has it been detailed in the Book, and the matter has been decreed by God, the Lord of the worlds.

Whoever reads a verse from My verses, it is better for him than reading the books of the former and latter generations.

This is the declaration of the Merciful, if you are of those who listen. Say: This is true knowledge, if you are of those who recognize.

## To the Concourse of the Bayan

The Primal Point had declared the exaltation of the Cause of Baha'u'llah over His own Cause.

We entered the School of God while you were asleep,

We observed the Tablet while you were heedless.

By the True One, We read it before its descent, while you were unaware.

We encompassed the Book while you were still in the loins.

This is My mention according to your capacity, not according to the measure of God. This is attested by what is in the knowledge of God, if only you knew, and by the Tongue of God, if only you understood. By God, were the veil to be lifted, you would be thunderstruck.
