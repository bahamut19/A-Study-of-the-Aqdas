In the name of the one who governs what was and what will be

## Recognize His Revelation and Follow His Command

1 The first thing that God has prescribed for His servants is the recognition of the dawning place of His Revelation and the source of His command, which is the station of His own Self in the realm of command and creation. Whoever attains this has attained all good, and whoever is deprived of it is indeed among the people of error, even if he performs every good deed. If you attain this exalted station and this supreme horizon, every soul must follow what has been commanded by the Desired One, for both are inseparable, one cannot be accepted without the other. This is what the Source of Inspiration has decreed.

2 Indeed, those who have been endowed with insight from God see the ordinances of God as the greatest means for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And those who are heedless of this are like the ignorant masses. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what has been decreed by the Supreme Pen. It is the spirit of life for those in existence. The seas of wisdom and eloquence have surged forth with the stirring breeze of the All-Merciful. Seize this opportunity, O possessors of intellect. Those who have violated the covenant of God concerning His commands and have turned back on their heels, they are indeed among the people of error in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted.

3 O assembly of the earth, know that My commands are the lamps of My care among My servants and the keys of My mercy for My creation. Thus has the command been revealed from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Lord of all religions. If anyone were to taste the sweetness of the utterance that has appeared from the mouth of the will of the All-Merciful, he would spend all that he possesses, even if it be the treasures of the entire earth, to uphold one of His commands which have dawned from the horizon of care and grace.

4 Say, from My laws the fragrance of My garment is diffused, and through them the banners of victory are hoisted on the hills and heights. The tongue of My power has spoken in the dominion of My greatness, addressing My creation: “Carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.” Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner. By My life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of grace will circle around My commands which have shone forth from the horizon of creativity.

5 Do not think that We have merely revealed to you the laws; rather, We have unsealed the choice sealed wine with the fingers of might and power. This is attested by what has been sent down by the Pen of Revelation. Reflect, O possessors of understanding.

## Prayer and Fasting

### Time of Day and Direction

6 It has been enjoined upon you to perform the prayer consisting of nine rak'ahs to God, the Revealer of the verses, at noon, in the morning, and in the evening. We have pardoned other numbers as a command in the Book of God. Indeed, it is the mighty, chosen command. When you wish to perform the prayer, turn your faces toward My most holy direction, the sacred spot which God has made the focal point for the celestial concourse and the point of adoration for the people of the cities of eternity, the source of command for those in the heavens and the earth. And at the setting of the Sun of Truth and Explanation, the place We have appointed for you, indeed, it is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

7 Everything is realized by His decisive command when the Sun of ordinances rises from the horizon of explanation. All are to follow it, even if it be a command that rends asunder the hearts of the adherents of religions. He does as He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. Whatever the Beloved has decreed is beloved and the Possessor of invention. Whoever finds the fragrance of the All-Merciful and recognizes the source of this Revelation will face the arrows with his eyes to uphold the ordinances among the people. Blessed is he who turns and attains the decisive utterance.

### The Prayer is Detailed in Another Document

8 We have detailed the prayer in another tablet. Blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded by the Lord of all beings. For the prayer for the dead, God, the Revealer of the verses, has ordained six Takbirs (Allāhu Akbar or God is the Greatest). Whoever possesses the knowledge of recitation may recite what has been revealed before it, and if not, God has pardoned him. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Forgiving.

### Hair And Other Materials Does Not Invalidate Prayer

9 Hair does not invalidate your prayers, nor do those things that prevent the spirit, such as bones and the like. Wear sable as you wear silk, brocade, and other such materials. It has not been forbidden in the Qur'an, but the learned were mistaken about it. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

### Prayer and Fasting From Age of Maturity

10 Prayer and fasting have been enjoined upon you from the age of maturity as a command from God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. For those who are weak due to illness or old age, God has excused them as a grace from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on any clean surface, and we have abrogated the rule regarding the specific limit in the Book. God knows, and you do not know. Whoever cannot find water should repeat five times, "In the Name of God, the Purest, the Purest," and then proceed with the prayer. This is what the Lord of the worlds has decreed. In lands where nights and days are prolonged, let them pray according to the hours and the timepieces that mark the passage of time. Indeed, He is the Manifest, the Wise.

### Prayer of the Signs

11 We have excused you from the Prayer of the Signs. When they appear, remember God with greatness and power. He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Say, "Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds."

### No Congregational Prayer Except Prayer for the Dead

12 Individual prayer has been enjoined upon you; the requirement for congregational prayer has been lifted except for the Prayer for the Dead. This is indeed a wise ordinance.

### Menstrating Women Are Pardoned from Fasting and Prayer

13 God has excused women from fasting and obligatory prayer during their menstrual periods. Instead, they are to perform ablutions and repeat the phrase "Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty" ninety-five times between noon on one day and noon the next. This is what has been decreed in the Book if you are among those who understand.

### Prayer While On a Journey

14 When traveling, both men and women, upon stopping and resting, can replace each obligatory prayer with a single prostration. During this prostration, recite "Glory be to God, the Lord of Grandeur and Majesty, of Bounty and Grace." If unable, simply say, "Glory be to God," for that suffices in truth. Indeed, He is the All-Sufficient, the Everlasting, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

After completing the prostration, sit in the posture of unity and say eighteen times, "Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty." Thus does God elucidate the paths of truth and guidance, all converging to this straight path. Thank God for this immense favor, praise God for this bounty encompassing the heavens and the earth, and remember God for this mercy surpassing all worlds.

15 Say, God has made the key to the hidden treasure My love, if you only knew. Without the key, it would remain hidden in the eternal past, if you only believed. This is for the dawning place of revelation and the horizon of radiance, through which the horizons are illumined, if you only knew. This is indeed the ordained decree, by which every decreed fate is established.

### Fasting For the Month Before the New Year

16 O Pen of the Most High, say: O assembly of creation, We have ordained for you fasting during a limited number of days, and have made Naw-Rúz a festival for you after its completion. Thus has the Sun of the Bayán shone forth from the horizon of the Book from the presence of the Lord of Origin and Return.

### Prior to Fasting, Festival of "Ha"

And let the days which exceed the months before the month of fasting be the manifestations of the letter "H" (Ha) among the nights and days. Therefore, they are not confined by the limits of the year and its months. It is incumbent upon the people of Bahá to provide for themselves, their relatives, the poor, and the needy, to exalt, magnify, and glorify their Lord with joy and gladness.

### Fasting Excused For Traveler, Sick, Pregnant, and Nursing

When the days of giving are completed, let them enter the fast. Thus has the Lord of all humankind decreed. There is no blame on travelers, the sick, pregnant women, or nursing mothers; God has excused them as a grace from Him. He is the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

### Fast From Sunrise to Sunset

17 These are the ordinances of God which have been inscribed by the Pen of the Most High in the scriptures and tablets. Hold fast to the commandments and laws of God, and do not be among those who have clung to their own principles and discarded the principles of God, following mere conjectures and illusions. Refrain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Beware lest your desires prevent you from this bounty that has been decreed in the Book.

### Ablutions

18 For those who believe in God, the Almighty, it is prescribed that they wash their hands and then their face every day, sit facing God, and recite ninety-five times "Alláh-u-Abhá" (God is Most Glorious). Thus has the Creator of the heavens decreed when He established Himself upon the thrones of His names with grandeur and power. Likewise, perform ablutions for the prayer as a command from God, the One, the Chosen.

## Harming Others

19 Murder, adultery, backbiting, and slander have been forbidden to you. Avoid what you have been prohibited from in the scriptures and tablets.

## Inheritance

20 God has apportioned inheritances according to the number of the letter Z, with shares for your descendants calculated from the Book of Ṭ according to the number of M, Q, and T. For spouses, the share is from the Book of Ḥ according to the number of T and F. For fathers, the share is from the Book of Z according to the number of T and K. For mothers, the share is from the Book of W according to the number of R, F, Y, and Ayn. For brothers, the share is from the Book of H according to the number of Sh. For sisters, the share is from the Book of D according to the number of R and M. For teachers, the share is from the Book of J according to the number of Q and F. This is decreed by the Herald who remembers Me in the nights and early mornings. When We heard the clamor of descendants in the loins, We doubled their share and reduced the others' share; indeed, He is the All-Powerful, doing what He wills with His authority as He pleases.

21 If one dies without descendants, their inheritance reverts to the House of Justice to be used by the trustees of the Merciful for orphans, widows, and general benefit, so that people may thank their Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving.

22 If one has descendants but lacks other specified heirs, two-thirds of their estate goes to the descendants, and one-third to the House of Justice, as decreed by the Exalted, the Majestic.

23 If there are no direct heirs but there are relatives such as nephews, nieces, or their children, two-thirds go to these relatives, and one-third to the House of Justice. If no such relatives exist, all the estate goes to the House of Justice to be used as God commands; He is the All-Powerful, the Ruler.

24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God's command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.

25 The inhabited house and specific garments are for the male descendants, not the females or other heirs; He is the Bestower, the Bountiful.

26 If someone dies during their parent's lifetime, their descendants inherit what would have gone to them, divided justly among them. Thus, the sea of speech has surged, casting forth pearls of laws from the Lord of all beings.

27 If there are weak descendants, appoint a trustee to manage their inheritance until they reach maturity, or invest it for them. Assign a rightful share of the profits to the trustee for their efforts.

28 All this is after the payment of God's right, debts, and funeral expenses, carried out with dignity and honor, as decreed by the Lord of Origin and Return.

29 Say, this is the hidden knowledge that will never change, for it began with the letter Ṭ indicating the hidden, manifest, invincible Name. This allotment to descendants is a bounty from God for them to thank their Merciful, Compassionate Lord. These are the boundaries of God; do not transgress them with your desires. Follow what you have been commanded by the Source of Revelation. The sincere see God's ordinances as the water of life for the faithful and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on earth and in the heavens.

## The House of Justice in Every City

30 God has ordained that in every city a House of Justice should be established, where individuals shall gather in the number of Bahá (9), or more if desired. They should regard themselves as entering the presence of the Exalted One, observing the unseen. These members must be the trusted ones of the Merciful among people and the representatives of God for all who dwell on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants of God for His sake, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is best. Thus has your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving, decreed. Beware not to neglect what is explicitly stated in the Tablet. Fear God, O people of insight.

## Houses In The Name of the Lord of All Religions

31 O assembly of creation, build houses in the best possible manner in the name of the Lord of religions in every land, and adorn them with what is befitting, not with pictures and images. Then, remember your Lord, the Merciful, with spirit and fragrance. It is through His remembrance that hearts are illumined and eyes are comforted.

## Pilgrimage to the House

32 God has ordained for those of you who are able, to make the pilgrimage to the House, but has excused women from this obligation out of His mercy. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Generous.

## Engagement in an Occupation is Worship

33 O people of Bahá, it is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, trades, and the like. We have made your engagement in such work equivalent to the worship of God, the True One. Reflect, O people, on the mercy and favors of God, and then thank Him in the evening and at dawn. Do not waste your time in idleness and sloth; engage in activities that benefit yourselves and others. Thus has the matter been decreed in this Tablet, from whose horizon the sun of wisdom and explanation has shone forth. The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idle and seek sustenance. Hold firmly to the rope of means, putting your trust in God, the Provider of all means.

## Repent to God Only

34 God has forbidden you from kissing hands in the Book; this is what you have been prohibited from by your Mighty, All-Powerful Lord. No one is permitted to seek forgiveness from another. Turn to God in repentance yourselves. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving.

## Stand Up In Service of the Command

35 O servants of the Merciful, arise to serve the Cause in such a way that the sorrows of those who disbelieve in the Source of the verses do not overcome you. When the promise was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, people differed and each group held onto their own conjectures and illusions.

## Do Not Deprive Yourself of What God Allows

36 Some people sit at the back, seeking prestige, and others claim hidden knowledge and esoteric understanding. Say, O heedless deceiver, who are you? And to those who claim deep inner knowledge, say, O liar, by God, what you possess is mere husks, left for you as bones are left for dogs. By the True One, if someone were to wash the feet of the world, worship God in the wilderness, forests, mountains, and heights, and near every stone, tree, and dust, yet not exude the fragrance of My approval, it would never be accepted. This is the judgment of the Lord of all beings.

Many have secluded themselves on the islands of India, denied themselves what God has permitted, borne ascetic hardships, yet are not remembered by God, the Revealer of the verses. Do not make actions the partner of hopes, nor deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the eternal past. Say, the spirit of deeds is My approval; everything is tied to My acceptance. Read the Tablets to know what is intended in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Whoever wins My love has the right to sit on the throne of gold in the highest place, and whoever is denied it, even if they sit on the dust, they seek refuge from it to God, the Lord of religions.

## Asserting a Proclamation Before a Thousand Years

37 Whoever claims a matter before the completion of a full thousand years is a lying impostor. We ask God to help him to recant if he repents, for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. But if he persists in what he has said, a punishment will be sent upon him from which there is no escape; He is indeed severe in punishment. Whoever interprets or explains this verse in a way other than its evident meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and His mercy, which has preceded all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your own illusions; follow what your Almighty, Wise Lord commands you. Soon, there will arise clamor from most lands. Avoid it, O people, and do not follow every wicked, contemptible one. This is what We have informed you of when We were in Iraq, in the land of mystery, and in this luminous spot.

## Rise to the Defense of God's Cause

38 O people of the earth, when the sun of My beauty sets and the heaven of My body is concealed, do not be troubled. Arise to assist My Cause and to exalt My word among the people of the world. We are with you in all conditions and will aid you with the truth. We have always been able to do so. Whoever recognizes Me will arise to serve Me with a steadfastness that even the hosts of the heavens and the earth cannot deter.

39 People are asleep; if they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts toward God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and cast aside all that they possess, even if it were all the treasures of the world, so that their Lord might remind them with a word from Himself. Thus, He informs you of what is hidden, through a Tablet that reveals what has appeared in existence, a knowledge that none has attained except His own Self, who reigns over all the worlds. The intoxication of desire has seized them to such an extent that they do not see the Lord of all creation, whose call has been raised from every direction: There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise.

### Blessed Are Days In Remembrance of God

40 Say: Rejoice not in that which you possess, for in the morning it shall belong to another. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed counsel you. Say: Have you found permanence in that which you possess, or fidelity? No, by Myself, the Most Merciful, if you are among the fair-minded. The days of your life pass as the winds blow, and your glory will be rolled up as was the glory of those before you. Reflect, O people, where are your past days, and where are your vanished years? Blessed are the days that were spent in the remembrance of God, and the hours devoted to His praise, the All-Wise. By My life, the glory of the exalted shall not endure, nor the ornaments of the wealthy, nor the power of the wicked. All shall perish by a single word from Him. Indeed, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. What people possess will not benefit them, and what would benefit them, they have neglected. They will awaken, but will find nothing of what they have missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If they knew, they would spend all they possess to have their names remembered before the Throne, but they are among the dead.

### Don't Be Deceived By Your Knowledge

41 Among the people, some are deceived by their knowledge and are thereby veiled from My Name, the Self-Subsisting. When they hear the sound of footsteps behind them, they see themselves as greater than Nimrod. Say: Where is he now, O rejected one? By God, he is in the lowest depths of hell. Say: O concourse of scholars, do you not hear the creaking of My Supreme Pen? Do you not see this sun shining from the most glorious horizon? How long will you continue to worship the idols of your desires? Abandon your illusions and turn toward God, your ancient Lord.

## Endowments Meant For Charitable Purposes

42 The endowments dedicated to charitable purposes have been returned to God, the Manifestation of the Signs. No one is permitted to administer them except with the permission of the Source of Revelation. After Him, the authority is passed to the Aghsán (the branches, referring to Bahá'u'lláh's descendants), and after them, to the House of Justice, should it be established in the land. They are to use these endowments in elevated places for this Cause and for whatever they are commanded by the Mighty, the Powerful One. If this is not realized, the endowments revert to the people of Bahá, who do not speak except by His permission and do not judge except according to what God has decreed in this Tablet. They are the champions of victory between the heavens and the earth, to use these resources as specified in the Book by the Mighty, the Generous One.

## Seek A Course Between Two Extremes

43 Do not despair in calamities, nor rejoice excessively in happiness. Seek a state between the two: to be mindful and aware of what may come to pass in the end. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed counsel you.

## Hair

44 Do not shave your heads; God has adorned them with hair, and in this are signs for those who consider the natural order established by the Lord of creation. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Wise. It is not proper to let it grow beyond the limits of the ears. This is what the Lord of all beings has decreed.

## Justice For the Thief

45 It has been decreed that the punishment for a thief is banishment and imprisonment. Upon a third offense, a mark should be placed on the thief's forehead so that they may be recognized and not accepted in the cities and lands of God. Beware that compassion does not prevent you from carrying out the laws of God. Act according to what you have been commanded by a compassionate and merciful Lord. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and laws for your own protection and the elevation of your station, just as parents nurture their children. By My life, if you knew what We intended for you with Our sacred commandments, you would sacrifice your lives for this holy, exalted, and mighty Cause.

## Use Utensils and Be Refined

46 Whoever wishes to use vessels of gold and silver, there is no harm in it. However, beware lest your hands immerse into dishes and plates without grace; take what is closest to refinement. He desires to see you adorned with the manners of the people of Paradise in His supreme, invincible dominion. Uphold refinement in all matters so that eyes do not fall upon what is displeasing to your souls and to the inhabitants of Paradise. Whoever disregards this, his action is nullified immediately; but if he has a valid excuse, God will forgive him. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Generous.

## God Is The Only Infallibility

47 There is no partner for the Source of the Cause in the greatest infallibility; He is the Manifestation who does what He wills in the Kingdom of creation. God has reserved this station for Himself, and no one else has been given a share in this mighty, exalted matter. This is the decree of God, which was hidden behind the veils of mystery. We have revealed it in this manifestation, and with it, We have torn the veil of those who did not understand the decree of the Book and were among the heedless.

## Fathers Must Educate His Children

48 It is enjoined upon every father to educate his son and daughter in learning and writing, and also in what has been prescribed in the Tablet. If he fails to do so, the trustees are to take from him whatever is necessary for their education, provided he is wealthy. Otherwise, the matter is to be referred to the House of Justice. We have made it a refuge for the poor and needy. Whoever educates his son, or any child, it is as though he has educated one of My own children. Upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness, and My mercy that has preceded the worlds.

## Fine For Adultery

49 God has decreed that for every man and woman who commits adultery, a fine must be paid to the House of Justice, amounting to nine mithqáls of gold. If they repeat the offense, the penalty is doubled. This is the decree of the Lord of Names for the first and second offenses. For a third offense, they are subjected to a humiliating punishment. Whoever is afflicted by sin should repent and turn back to God. He forgives whom He wills and is not questioned about what He wills, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

## Develop a Relationship with God

50 Beware lest the splendors of majesty prevent you from the pure and flowing waters of this clear stream. Take the cups of prosperity in this morning in the name of the Creator of the dawn, and then drink with the remembrance of His mighty and wondrous Name.

## Music Is a Ladder For the Soul

51 We have permitted you to listen to music and melodies. However, beware that your listening does not lead you away from the path of dignity and reverence. Rejoice in the joy of My Greatest Name, by which hearts are enraptured and the minds of the near ones are attracted. We have made it a ladder for the ascent of souls to the highest horizon. Do not make it the wings of self and desire. I seek refuge in God that you may not be among the ignorant.

## Blood Money To the House of Justice

52 We have allocated one-third of all blood money (diyah) to the Seat of Justice, and We counsel its members to dispense it with absolute justice, to spend what has accumulated with them on what they have been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O men of justice, be shepherds of the sheep of God in His dominion, and protect them from the wolves who have appeared in garments, just as you would protect your own children. Thus does the trustworthy Counselor advise you.

## Wisdom in Baha'u'llah's Absence

53 If you differ on any matter, refer it to God as long as the sun is shining from this heaven. And when it sets, refer to what has been revealed from Him, for it is sufficient for the peoples of the world.

Say: O people, do not let turmoil overtake you if the kingdom of My manifestation disappears and the waves of the sea of My utterance become still. In My appearance, there is wisdom, and in My concealment, there is another wisdom known only to God, the One, the All-Knowing. We behold you from Our most glorious horizon, and We shall aid anyone who rises to assist My Cause with the hosts of the celestial realm and a company of the nearest angels.

## Detachment

54 O people of the earth! By the truth of God, rivers of fresh and pure water have gushed forth from the stones due to the sweetness of the utterance of your Lord, the Chosen One, yet you remain heedless. Abandon what you possess and soar with the wings of detachment above the realm of creation. Thus does the Lord of innovation command you, He who, with the movement of His Pen, has turned the worlds upside down.

55 Do you know from which horizon your most glorious Lord calls you? And have you realized by which Pen your Lord, the Possessor of all names, commands you? No, by My life! If you knew, you would abandon the world, turning with your hearts towards the Beloved, and the vibration of the Word would seize you in such a manner that the greater world would tremble, let alone this lesser world. Thus, from the heaven of My bounty, the showers of My grace have poured down as a favor from Me, so that you may be among the thankful.

## Injuries to the Head and Body

56 As for injuries to the head and body, their rulings vary according to their severity, and the Judge (or the All-Knowing One) has prescribed a specific compensation (diyah) for each level. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Exalted Judge. If We so wish, We could detail them with justice, as a promise from Us. Verily, He is the Fulfiller, the Most High.

## Extend Hospitality Monthly

57 Hospitality has been prescribed for you once each month, even if it is only with water. God has desired to bring hearts together, even through the means of heaven and earth.

## Be Like Fingers In a Hand

58 Beware lest the affairs of the self and desire cause division among you. Be like the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body. Thus does the Pen of Revelation counsel you, if you are of those who believe with certainty.

59 Behold the mercy and grace of God. He commands you that which benefits you, though He is independent of all the worlds. Your evil deeds do not harm Us, just as your good deeds do not benefit Us. We call you only for the sake of God; this is witnessed by every discerning, clear-sighted one.

## Avoid Excess in Hunting

60 If you send out hunting animals to catch prey, mention the name of God, and what they catch for you is permissible, even if you find it dead. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware that you do not act excessively in this matter. Be on the path of justice and fairness in all things. Thus does the Source of Revelation command you, if you are among those who understand.

## Show Kindness to Kin, No Right in People's Wealth

61 God has commanded you to show love and kindness to your kindred, but He has not ordained for them any right to the wealth of the people. Indeed, He is the One Who is independent of all the worlds.

## Arson and Murder Penalties

62 Whoever deliberately burns a house, burn him; and whoever intentionally kills a person, kill him. Take the laws of God with the hands of power and might, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. However, if you decide to imprison them for life, there is no harm in this according to the Book. Indeed, He is the Judge over what He wills.

## Marriage

### One Wife Best, Two Wives Allowed

63 God has enjoined upon you marriage. Beware that you do not exceed two wives. He who is content with one maid will ensure his own tranquility and hers as well. There is no harm for the one who chooses a virgin for his service. Thus has the matter been recorded by the Pen of Revelation in truth. Marry, O people, so that there may appear from you those who will remember Me among My servants. This is My commandment to you; take it as an aid for yourselves.

### Do Not Spread Corruption

64 O people of creation! Do not follow your own selves, for they incite to oppression and lewdness. Follow the Lord of all things, who commands you to righteousness and piety. Indeed, He is independent of all the worlds. Beware that you do not corrupt the earth after it has been reformed, and whoever causes corruption is not of Us, and We are clear of him. Thus has the matter been revealed from the heaven of Revelation in truth.

### Marriage Requires Consent of Parents

65 He has indeed stipulated in the scripture that it is with the satisfaction of both parties. When we desired love, affection, and unity among servants, we therefore attached it with the permission of the parents, so that no enmity or hatred would arise between them. We have other objectives in it as well. Thus, the command has been determined.

### Dowry

66 Dowry can only be validated by Mahr (marital gift). For cities, nineteen weights of pure gold have been set as Mahr, and for villages, it is in silver. If one wishes to increase it, it is prohibited for him to exceed ninety-five weights. Thus, the command was inscribed with dignity. And he who is content with the first degree (minimum Mahr) it is better for him according to the scripture. Indeed, He grants abundance to whom He wills through the means of the heavens and the earth. And Allah has power over everything.

### A Spouse Must Provide Future Rendezvous With Partner

67 Allah has ordained for every servant intending to leave his homeland, to set a rendezvous for his partner, a period of any length he desires. If he arrives and fulfills his promise, he is indeed following his Master's command and is among the benefactors, as written by the pen of command. Unless he excuses himself for a legitimate reason, he should inform his partner and put maximum effort into returning to her. If he defaults on both matters, she has a waiting period of nine counted months. After completing them, there is no harm for her in choosing a husband. But if she is patient, indeed, He loves those who are patient among women and men. Follow My commands and do not follow every idolater who is sinful in the Tablet.

If news arrives during her waiting period, she can take what is reasonable; indeed, He desires reconciliation between servants and women. Beware not to commit actions that cause stubbornness among you. Thus, the command is decided, and the promise is fulfilled. If she receives news of his death or murder and it is confirmed by spreading news or two just persons, she has the right to stay in the house if specified months have passed. She has a choice in what she chooses. This is what is ruled by the one who has power over the command.

### A Year of Patience Before Divorce

68 If there occurs between them a period of discord or dislike, he has no right to divorce her, and he has the right to be patient for a complete year, perhaps a scent of love may emerge between them. And if the year is completed and love has not blossomed, there is no harm in divorce, indeed He is wise in all matters.

Allah has forbidden you from what you did after three divorces, as a favor from Him so you may be among the grateful, recorded in a Tablet by the pen of command. And he who divorces has the option to return after the completion of each month with affection and satisfaction unless she is fortified. And when she is fortified, the separation is confirmed with the last bond and the matter is decided except after clear command. Thus, the command was from the brilliance of beauty, recorded in the Tablet of Majesty with veneration.

### Discord Between Spouses While Travelling

69 And he who travels, and she travels with him, then discord occurs between them, he has the right to provide her with a full year's expenditure and return her to the residence from which she departed, or he can entrust her to a trustworthy person, and what she needs for the journey to bring her back to her place. Indeed, your Lord rules as He wishes, with an authority that encompasses the worlds.

### Reconciliation Better Than Divorce

70 And the one who was divorced, on whom wrongdoing has been proven, there is no expenditure for her during her waiting period. Thus, the directive was clear from the horizon of justice. Indeed, God loves reconciliation and harmony and detests separation and divorce. Live, O people, with spirit and fragrant (benevolence). By my life, everyone in existence will perish, and what remains is good deeds. Indeed, God is a witness to what I say. O my servants, reconcile amongst yourselves, then listen to what the highest pen advises you, and do not follow a wicked tyrant.

71 Beware that the world does not deceive you, as it has deceived people before you. Follow the limits of God and His paths, then tread this path that was extended in truth. Indeed, those who have cast aside wrongdoing and nonsense and embraced piety, they are among the best of creation according to the truth. They are remembered by the highest assembly and the inhabitants of this station that has been elevated in the name of God.

## No Trade in Slaves and Children

72 God has forbidden you to trade in slaves and children. No servant is to buy another servant; this is a prohibition in the Tablet of God. So is the order inscribed with justice and bounty. And no one should boast over anyone else, everyone has their highs and lows, signifying that there is no deity but Him. Indeed, He is wise over all things.

## Support the Creator with Good Deeds, Wisdom, Clarity

73 Adorn yourselves with the embroidery of good deeds. Those who excel in acting in His pleasure, they indeed are the people of splendor and are mentioned near the throne.

Support the Creator of all beings with good deeds, then with wisdom and clarity. This is how you have been commanded in many of the tablets from The Most Merciful. Indeed, He is knowledgeable of what I say. No one should harm another, nor should a life take a life. This is what you have been forbidden in a book that was kept in a pavilion of honor. Would you kill those whom God has brought to life with a spirit from Him? This is a great mistake before the throne. Fear God, and do not destroy what God has built with the hands of oppression and tyranny. Then take the path to truth when the armies of knowledge have emerged with the banners of clarity, all the tribes of religions are defeated, except for those who wish to drink from the river of life in divine pleasure, they were present from the spirit of the Praised One.

## Purity, Purifying, and Gentleness

74 God has decreed purity for the water of the sperm as a mercy from Him to the creatures. Praise Him with spirituality and fragrance, and do not follow those who are far from the rise of closeness. Stand up for the service of the command in all circumstances. He supports you with authority that encompasses all worlds. Hold on to the rope of gentleness, so no traces of filth are seen on your clothes. This is what has been decreed by the One who is gentler than all gentle. And for the one who has an excuse, there is no harm upon him, for He is the Forgiver, the Merciful. Purify every disliked thing with water that has not changed by a third. Beware of using water that has changed due to air or something else. Be the element of gentleness among creatures. This is what your Powerful, Wise Master desires for you.

75 And thus God has elevated the rule of purity above all things and other creeds, a gift from God, for He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Everything has been immersed in the sea of purity at the beginning of Divine pleasure when we revealed ourselves to everyone in the universe with our beautiful names and superior attributes. This is from My grace that encompasses all the worlds, so you may interact with the religions and communicate the command of your Merciful Lord. This is for the crown of deeds if you are from the knowledgeable ones.

## Be Pure in Prayer

76 And He ruled with the greatest kindness, and the washing of what has been tarnished by dust, and the freezing of dirt, and beneath it. Fear God and be among those who purify. And he who sees filth in his garments, surely his prayers do not ascend to God, and the high-ranked avoid him.

Use rose water, then pure perfume. This is what God loved from the First, who has no beginning, so that what your Mighty, Wise Lord wanted might emerge from you.

## Sciences That Benefit You

77 God has pardoned you for what was mentioned in the scriptures about the erasure of books, and has granted you permission to read from the sciences what benefits you, not what leads to argumentation in speech. This is better for you, if indeed you are among those who know.

## To the Assembly of Kings

78 O assembly of kings, the Sovereign has come and the kingdom belongs to Allah, the Guardian, the Everlasting. Worship none but Allah, and direct your hearts, illuminated, towards the face of your Lord, the Master of Names. This command is incomparable to what you have, if indeed you understand.

### Wealth Distracts From the Ultimate Purpose

79 Indeed, We see you rejoice in what you have gathered for others, yet depriving yourselves of the worlds that none but the Preserved Tablet has enumerated. Wealth has distracted you from the ultimate purpose; this is not befitting for you, if only you knew. Purify your hearts from the dregs of the world, hastening towards the dominion of your Lord, the Originator of the earth and the heavens, by whom the earthquakes have appeared and the tribes have lamented. Except those who have rejected the masses and embraced what has been commanded in the hidden Tablet.

80 This is a day when the speaker triumphs with the lights of the Ancient One and drinks the crystal clear waters of union from this cup that stirred the oceans. Say, by God, the truth is that the Mount orbits around the place of appearance, and the spirit calls from the dominion, "Come forth and ascend, O sons of vanity."

This is a day when the mountain of God rushed with longing for His meeting and Zion cried out, "The promise has come, and what was written in the Tablets of God, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beloved, has appeared."

### The Greater Law is Revealed

81 O assembly of kings, the Greater Law has been revealed in the luminous scene, and every hidden matter has appeared from the hands of the Master of Destiny. By Him, the Hour has come, the moon has split, and every decreed matter has been detailed.

### The Kings are the Subjects - Rise to Serve

82 O assembly of kings, you are the subjects, the Sovereign has appeared in the most beautiful design and invites you to Himself, the Preserver, the Sustainer. Beware that arrogance does not prevent you from the rising place of Manifestation, or that the world does not veil you from the Creator of the heavens. Rise to serve the Intended One, who created you with a Word from Himself and made you the manifestations of power for what has been and what will be.

83 By God, we do not wish to interfere in your kingdoms, but we have come to change hearts, for they are the mirrors of glory. The kingdom of names bears witness to this if you understand. And he who follows his Lord indeed turns away from the entire world, and how commendable is this praised position! Leave your homes and then turn to the kingdom. This is what benefits you in the hereafter and the first. The owner of the dominion bears witness to this if you know.

84 Blessed is the king who has stood for the support of My Cause in My Kingdom and has cut off from all else. Indeed, he is among the companions of the Crimson Ark, which God has made for the people of glory. It is fitting for everyone to honor him, respect him, and support him so that he may open cities with the keys of My Dominant Name to those in the kingdoms of the unseen and witnessed.

Indeed, he is like the vision for the humans, the most resplendent luminary for the forehead of creation, and the head of generosity for the body of the world. O people of glory, support him with your wealth and souls.

## To the Emperor of Austria (Franz Joseph I)

85 O King of Austria! The dawn of Divine Unity emerged in the prison of Akka. You passed by the Al-Aqsa Mosque but never inquired after it. With it, every house was elevated and every exalted door was opened. We have made it the focus of the world for My remembrance, but you have discarded the mentioned one as it emerged in the Kingdom of your God, the Lord of all worlds. We have been with you in all conditions and found you clinging to the branch, oblivious of the root. Indeed, your Lord bears witness to what I say.

Our hearts are filled with sorrow at seeing you revolving around Our name, yet not recognizing Us before your face. Open your eyes, so you may behold this noble sight, recognize the One you call upon in nights and days, and see the luminous light emerging from this gleaming horizon.

## To the King of Berlin (Otto von Bismarck)

86 Say, O King of Berlin, hear the call from this manifest temple that there is no deity but Me, the Everlasting, the Single, the Ancient. Beware that arrogance prevents you from the dawn of manifestation or desire veils you from the Owner of the heavens and the earth. So advises you the Most High Pen, for He is the Gracious, the Generous. Remember those who were greater than you in status and higher than you in rank, where are they and what is with them? Be alert and do not be among those who are asleep. Indeed, he rejected the Tablet of God and saw it when we informed him of what was brought upon us by the armies of the oppressors.

Therefore, humiliation overtook him from all sides until he returned to dust with great loss. O King, reflect upon him and upon others like you who mocked the lands and ruled over the people. The Merciful has brought them down from the palaces to the graves. Take a lesson and be among those who remember.

87 Indeed, we seek nothing from you. We only advise you for the sake of God and we patiently endure as we endured what has come upon us from you, O assembly of sovereigns.

## To the Kings and Leaders of the Americas

88 O kings of America and leaders of its republics, listen to what the greenery sings on the branch of eternity: There is no god but I, the Everlasting, the Forgiving, the Generous.

Adorn the temple of the kingdom with the design of justice and piety, and crown its head with a wreath of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus commands you the source of the Names, from the All-Knowing, the Wise.

The Promised One has appeared in this praiseworthy place, with which the existence smiles from the unseen and witnessed. Seize the day of God, for meeting Him is better for you than anything upon which the sun rises, if you are among those who know.

O assembly of rulers, hear what has arisen from the source of majesty: There is no god but I, the Speaker, the Knowledgeable. Repair the broken with the hands of justice, and break the oppressive correct one with the whip of the commands of your Wise Lord.

## To the Assembly of Rome (Constantinople)

89 O assembly of Rome, we hear amongst you the sound of an owl. Has the intoxication of passion overtaken you, or were you among the heedless?

O you, the point located at the coast of the two seas, the seat of oppression has been established upon you, and the fire of hatred has ignited within you, about which the Highest Assembly and those who circulate around the exalted throne lament.

We see in you the ignorant ruling over the wise, and the darkness boasting over the light, and indeed you are in clear delusion. Your apparent beauty has deceived you, it will perish, by the Lord of Creatures. And the daughters, the widows, and the tribes within you will wail. Thus informs you the All-Knowing, the Aware.

## The Rhine Covered in Blood

90 O banks of the Rhine, we have seen you covered in blood because of the retributive swords unleashed upon you, and for you there will be another time. And we hear the lament of Berlin, even though today it stands in apparent glory.

## To The Land of Ṭā (Tehran)

91 O land of Ṭā, do not grieve for anything. God has made you a source of joy for all the worlds. If He wishes, He could bless your homeland with someone who rules with justice and gathers the scattered sheep of God from the wolves. Indeed, He presents the people of glory with joy and expansion. Indeed, this is from the essence of creation in the sight of the Truth. By the Glory of God and the glory of all who are in the dominion of His command at all times.

92 Rejoice in what God has made you: the horizon of light, as in you appeared the dawning-place of the Manifestation and you were named by this Name which has lit up the lamp of grace and illuminated the heavens and the earth.

93 The state of affairs will be reversed in you and the majority of people will judge upon you. Indeed, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Be at ease with the grace of your Lord; His favor will never cease from you. Tranquility will embrace you after turmoil. Such is the decree in the magnificent Book.

## To The Land of Kha (Khurasan)

94 O Land of 'Kh', we hear within you the voice of men in the remembrance of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed be the day when the banners of the Names will be hoisted in the Kingdom of Creation with My most glorious Name. On that day, the faithful will rejoice with the victory of God, and the polytheists will mourn.

95 No one should interfere with those who govern over the people. Leave what they have to them and turn your attention towards the hearts.

96 O Great Sea, shower upon the nations what you have been commanded by the Eternal Sovereign, and adorn the temples of humanity with the patterns of wisdom that gladden hearts and delight eyes.

## Purify Your Wealth

97 And he who possesses a hundred weights of gold, nineteen weights are for God, the Creator of the earth and the heavens. Beware, O people, not to withhold yourselves from this immense bounty. We have commanded you this after being independent of you and everyone in the heavens and earth. Indeed, in this is a decree and benefits which no one has knowledge of except God, the Knowing, the Informed. Say, it is intended to purify your wealth and bring you closer to stations that none can reach except by the will of God. He is indeed the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous. O people, do not be unfaithful in the rights of God and do not dispense it except with His permission. So is the decree in the Tablets and in this impregnable Tablet. Whoever betrays God is met with just retribution, and he who acts as commanded receives blessings from the sky of his Lord's generous gift, the Giver, the Provider, the Ancient.

He intends for you what you do not know today, people will know when the spirits soar and the carpets of joy are folded. Thus, he reminds you from him is an inscribed Tablet.

98 Various petitions have arrived at the Throne from those who believed and they asked God, the Lord of what can be seen and what cannot be seen, the Lord of the Worlds. Therefore, we revealed the Tablet and adorned it with the design of the Command so that people might act in accordance with their Lord's rulings. Likewise, we were asked before in consecutive years and we withheld the Pen, a wisdom from Us, until numbered souls were present in those days. Therefore, we answered them with the truth, with what gives life to hearts.

## To the Assembly of Scholars

### Do Not Use Your Own Principles and Sciences

99 Say, O assembly of scholars, do not weigh the Book of God against your own principles and sciences. It is indeed the balance of truth among creation. What is with the nations is to be weighed by this great balance, and it by itself, if you but knew.

100 My watchful eye weeps for you, because you have not recognized the One you invoke in the dusk and dawn, and at every sunset and sunrise. Turn, O people, with bright faces and radiant hearts towards the blessed crimson spot where the Lote Tree of the ultimate end proclaims, "There is no deity but I, the Overseer, the Self-Sustaining."

101 O assembly of scholars, can any of you dare to engage with me in the arena of unveiling and gnosis, or to traverse the track of wisdom and explanation? No, by my Lord, the Compassionate, all upon it shall perish, and this is the countenance of your beloved and mighty Lord.

## To the People

102 O people, we have indeed ordained knowledge for the recognition of the Known, yet you have used it to veil yourselves from its source, from which every concealed matter has been revealed. If you truly understood the horizon from which the sun of discourse has risen, you would abandon creation and all that is with them, and you would turn to the praised station.

103 Say, this is the sky in which the mother of the book, the source of all knowledge, is contained if you truly comprehend. This is the one with which the rock cried out and the Lote-Tree called out on the elevated mount, on the blessed land. Sovereignty belongs to God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Loving.

104 Indeed, we did not enter schools nor did we study various subjects. Listen to what this unlettered one calls you to, towards the eternal God. Indeed, it is better for you than what is stored in the earth, if you understand.

## Do Not Interpret and Deviate From Its Apparent Meaning

105 Indeed, the one who interprets what has descended from the heavens of revelation and deviates it from its apparent meaning, they are the ones who distort the supreme word of God, and they are among the losers as is clear in the Book.

## Trim Your Nails and Bath Weekly

106 It has been decreed for you to trim your nails and immerse your bodies in water every week, and clean your bodies with what you have used before. Beware, let not negligence keep you from what you are commanded by the Mighty, the Great. Immerse in fresh water, and it is not permissible to immerse in used water. Beware, do not approach the latrines of the foreigners. Whoever aims for it, will find its foul smell even before entering it. Avoid it, O people, and do not be among the humiliated.

It is likened to pus and dirt if you are knowledgeable. And so are their foul-smelling enclosures. Leave them and be among the sanctified. We wished to see you as the manifestations of paradise on earth so that what sprouts from you will bring joy to the hearts of the near ones. The one who pours water on himself and cleans his body with it is better for him and it spares him the immersion. He wanted to make matters easy for you as a grace from Him, so that you may be among the thankful.

## Do Not Marry Your Fathers' Wives or Young Boys

107 It has been forbidden for you to marry your fathers' wives. We feel ashamed to even mention the rule regarding young boys. Fear the Merciful, O inhabitants of all places, and do not commit what you have been forbidden in the Tablet. And do not be among those who wander aimlessly in the meadows of lust.

## Engaging In the Remembrance of God In Designated Places

108 No one should move their tongue publicly when walking in the streets and markets. Instead, those who wish to engage in remembrance should do so in a place designated for the remembrance of God, or in their own homes. This is closer to sincerity and piety. Thus, the sun of wisdom has risen from the horizon of explanation. Blessed are those who act accordingly.

## Writing a Will

109 Every soul is obligated to write a will, and they have the right to adorn their will with the Greatest Name, confessing therein the oneness of God in the manifestation of His appearance. In the will, they can mention any benevolence they wish to be known for, so it may serve as a witness for them in the worlds of command and creation, and will become a treasure for them with their Lord, the Keeper, the Trustworthy.

## Two Greatest Feast Days

110 The holidays have concluded to the two greatest feast days. The first one is the days in which The Merciful manifested Himself to everyone through His Most Beautiful Names and Superior Attributes. The second is the day on which We sent one who gave the glad tidings to the people with this Name, through which the dead arose and gathered all those in the heavens, the earth, and the others, within two days. Thus, the matter has been decreed from an Order of the High.

## Victory on the First Day of the Month of Splendor

111 Blessed is the one who is victorious on the first day of the month of Splendor, which God has made for this great name. Blessed is the one who demonstrates God's bounty upon himself on this day. Indeed, he is the one who shows gratitude to God through actions that signify His grace that encompasses all the worlds. Say: Indeed, it is the beginning of the months and its initiator, and through it the breath of life passes over all possible existences. Blessed is the one who perceives it with spirit and sweet fragrance. We testify that he is among the successful ones.

## The Sovereign of Feasts

112 Say: Indeed, the Greatest Feast is the Sovereign of Feasts. Remember, O people, God's blessing upon you when you were asleep; He awakened you with the breezes of revelation and guided you to His clear, straight path.

## Seek Help From Wise Doctors

113 If you fall ill, seek help from the wise among doctors. We have not nullified the means; rather, we have confirmed them through this pen that God has made the source of His radiant command.

## A Requirement Has Been Pardoned

114 God has decreed for every soul to present itself before the Throne with what it possesses that has no equal. We have graciously pardoned this requirement from our side. Indeed, He is the Generous Giver.

## The Dawning Place of Remembrances

115 Blessed is the one who turns towards the Dawning-place of Remembrances in the early mornings, mindful, remembering, and seeking forgiveness. And when they enter, they sit silently, not interrupting the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say, the Dawning-place of Remembrances is every house built in My name in the cities and the villages. Thus, it is named in the presence of the Throne, if you are among those who know.

## Recite the Verses in the Most Beautiful Melodies

116 And those who recite the verses of the Compassionate in the most beautiful melodies, they will attain from them that which no dominion of the King of heavens and earths can match. And through them, they will discover the knowledge of worlds which are unknown today except to those who have been given sight from this noble perspective. Say, indeed, they attract pure hearts towards the spiritual worlds which cannot be described in words nor indicated by signs. Blessed are the listeners.

## Support Those Who Remember God and Raised His Word

117 Support, O people, my chosen ones who have stood in my remembrance among my creation and raised my word in my kingdom. They are the stars of the sky of my providence and the lamps of my guidance for all creatures. And he who speaks other than what has been revealed in the tablets is not from me. Beware of following every sinful claimant. The tablets have been adorned with the seal of the Dawn Splitter, who speaks between the heavens and the earths. Hold fast to the firm handhold and the strong, unbreakable rope of my command.

## Learning Different Languages

118 God has permitted whoever wishes to learn the different languages so as to convey God's command to the east and the west of the earth, and to mention Him among nations and religions, so that hearts may be drawn by it, and every dry bone may be revived by it.

## Unwise to Consume That Which Takes Away Reason

119 It is not for the wise to consume that which takes away reason, and one should act in a manner that befits a human being, not in the way that every careless, dubious person behaves.

## Honesty, Loyalty, Piety, Truthfulness, Manners

120 Adorn your heads with the crown of honesty and loyalty, your hearts with the robe of piety, your speech with pure truthfulness, and your bodies with the adornments of manners. All this is from the virtue of a human being if you are among those who contemplate. O people of Baha, hold onto the rope of servitude to the true God. With it, your positions will be revealed, your names will be affirmed, your ranks will be raised, and your remembrances will be recorded in a preserved tablet. Do not let what is on earth prevent you from this exalted, high station. We have advised you about this in many tablets and in this tablet, which has illuminated from its horizon the radiant laws of your capable, wise Lord.

## Turn Towards Whom God Wills

121 When the sea of union storms and the decree of the origin is fulfilled in the ultimate destiny, turn towards whom God wills, the one who has branched out from this ancient root.

## True Freedom

122 Consider people and the scarcity of their wisdom; they seek what harms them and abandon what benefits them. Indeed, they are among those who wander in ignorance. We see some people who desire freedom and take pride in it; those are in clear ignorance.

123 Indeed, the outcomes of freedom lead to a strife whose fire does not extinguish. This is what the all-knowing Recorder informs you. Know then that the realms and manifestations of freedom belong to the animal world. For humans, it is appropriate to be under laws that protect them from their own ignorance and the harm of deceivers. Freedom takes people away from matters of manners and dignity and makes them among the most contemptible.

124 Observe creation, like sheep they must have a shepherd to guard them. This is a certain truth. We verify this in some situations over others, indeed we are all-knowing.

125 Say, freedom is in obeying My commands if you are among those who know. If people followed what We have revealed to them from the heavens of revelation, they would surely find themselves in pure freedom. Blessed is the one who understands the will of God in what He has revealed from the heavens of His sovereign will over all worlds. Say, the freedom that benefits you is truly in servitude to God the Truth. And whoever has found its sweetness would not exchange it for the dominion of the King of heavens and earth.

## Ask What Benefits You

126 It is forbidden for you to ask about the explanation. God has forgiven this so that you may ask what you need for yourselves, not what men before you have discussed. Fear God and be among the righteous. Ask about what benefits you in the matter of God and His authority. Indeed, the door of grace has been opened to all who are in the heavens and the earth.

## Nineteen Month Calendar

127 Indeed, the number of months is nineteen months in the book of God. Its beginning has been adorned with this supreme name over all the worlds.

## Burial of the Deceased

128 God has decreed the burial of the deceased in crystal, impenetrable stones, or fine, solid woods, and the placement of engraved seals on their fingers. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

129 For men and God belong all that is in the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and God is All-Knowing of all things. For the leaves and God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and God is over all things competent. This is what has been revealed before, and the Point of Explanation calls out and says, "O Beloved of places, speak in this position with what emanates from your tender breezes among the worlds. Indeed, we have informed all that a single word from you cannot be matched with what has been revealed in the explanation. Indeed, you are capable of what you will. Do not prevent your servants from the outpourings of your mercy's sea. Indeed, you are the One with the immense grace." We have responded to what He wants. Indeed, He is the Beloved, the Responsive.

If they inscribe on them what is revealed at the moment from God, indeed it is better for them. Indeed, we were the Judges. It has begun from God and returned to Him, cut off from other than Him, and clinging to His name, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Thus, God selects whom He wills with His grace. Indeed, He is the Capable, the Powerful.

130 And if you shroud them in five garments of silk or cotton, for those who cannot, they should suffice with one of them. Thus, the matter is decreed from the All-Knowing, the Well-Acquainted. It is forbidden for you to transport the deceased more than a distance of one hour from the city. Bury them with spirit and fragrance in a nearby place.

## Relationship with the Bayan

131 God has revoked what the Bayan decreed regarding travel restrictions. Indeed, He is the Chosen One, who does as He pleases and ordains as He wishes.

132 O assembly of creation, listen to the call of the Master of names. He is calling you from the midst of His Great Prison. Indeed, there is no god but Him, the Powerful, the Arrogant, the Dominant, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the Wise. There is no god but He, the Powerful over all the worlds. If He wishes, He can seize the world with a single word from Him. Beware not to hesitate in this matter, to which the highest assembly and the people of the cities of names have submitted. Fear God, and be not among those who veil themselves.

Burn away the veils with the fire of My love and glorify with this name by which We have subjected the worlds.

## Raise the Two Houses

133 And indeed, raise the two houses in the two positions and the positions in which the throne of your merciful Lord has settled. Thus, the Master of the Knowing commands you.

## Be Manifestations of Righteousness

134 Beware that the affairs of the world do not prevent you from what you have been commanded by the Strong, the Trustworthy. Be manifestations of righteousness among creation, so that the doubts of those who disbelieve in God, when He appeared with a great authority, do not hinder you. Beware that what has been revealed in the Book does not prevent you from this Book that speaks the truth. "Indeed, there is no god but I, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy."

Look with the eye of fairness at the one who has come from the sky of Will and Power, and do not be among the wrongdoers.

135 Then remember what has transpired from my promising pen in the mention of this manifestation, and what the tyrants have committed during its days. Indeed, they are the losers. He said, if you perceive what we have manifested, you are from the grace of God, asking Him to bestow His grace upon you by establishing His presence within your inner realities. For indeed, that is a grandeur that is inaccessible and impervious. To drink a cup of water in your presence is greater than for every soul to drink the water of His existence. Indeed, everything, if you only understood, O my servants!

136 This is what has been revealed from Him as a remembrance for myself, if only you knew. And the one who contemplates these verses and delves into what has been hidden within them from the treasured mysteries, by God, they will find the recognition of the Merciful from within the prison, and their heart will rush towards Him with longing that no forces of the heavens and the earth could prevent. Say, this is a manifestation around which the proofs and evidences orbit. Thus has the Merciful revealed it if you are among those who are fair. Say, this is the spirit of the scriptures that has been blown into the supreme pen, and everyone in creation was struck except for those who were touched by the breezes of My mercy and the fragrances of My beneficence, who is sovereign over all the worlds.

## The Direction of Prayer

137 O people of the Bayan, fear the Merciful and then look at what He has revealed in another place. He said: "The Qibla (direction of prayer) is only what God makes it manifest; when it turns, you turn, until it settles down." Thus has it been revealed from the Possessor of Power when He intended to mention this greatest spectacle. Reflect, O people, and do not be among those who wander astray. If you deny this due to your own whims, towards which verse or direction will you turn, O assembly of the heedless? Reflect upon this verse, then be fair for the sake of God. Perhaps you will find the mysteries hidden in the ocean that surged with My Powerful, Invincible Name.

## Do Not Cling to Verses of Prior Manifestations

138 Today, no one should cling to anything other than what has appeared in this manifestation. This is the judgment of God, before and after, and with it the scrolls of the predecessors were adorned. This is the remembrance of God, before and after, with which the brocade of the book of existence has been embellished, if you are among those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after, beware lest you be among the abased. Nothing can benefit you today, and no one has any refuge except God, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Whoever recognizes Me has recognized the Purpose. Whoever turns towards Me has turned towards the Beloved. Thus has it been detailed in the Book, and the matter has been decreed from God, Lord of the worlds. Whoever reads a verse from My verses, it is better for him than to read the books of the former and the latter. This is the statement of the Merciful, if you are among the listeners.

Say: This is the truth of knowledge, if you are among those who understand.

## Union With Another Should Elevate the Command of God

139 Then, consider what has been revealed in another status, hoping that you might invoke what you possess, turning towards Allah, the Lord of the worlds. It was stated that it is not permissible for a union unless it is explicitly stipulated in the statement. If one party enters into the union, it becomes forbidden for the other party to exercise what they possess from their end unless that is reverted after a command has been elevated from what we have made apparent in truth, or what has appeared justly. Before that happens, you should strive to approach it, hoping that by doing so, you elevate the command of Allah. Thus, the leaves rustled on the branches, mentioning their Merciful Lord. Blessed are those who listen.

## Why God Changes the Laws

140 O assembly of the statements, I swear you by your Lord, the Merciful, to look at what has been revealed in truth with an eye of fairness and not to be among those who see the evidence of God and deny it. Indeed, they are the ones who are ruined. The point of the statement has been clearly articulated in this verse by the elevation of my command before his command. Every fair and knowledgeable person bears witness to that. As you see it today, it has risen to a status that is only denied by those whose vision has been blurred in the past and in the future. For them, there is a humiliating punishment.

141 Say, "By Allah, indeed I am beloved, and now listen to what descends from the heavens of revelation and lament for what you have committed in its days. Fear Allah, and do not be among the transgressors.

Say, 'O people, if you do not believe in it, do not oppose it. By Allah, what has gathered against it from the armies of the oppressors is sufficient."

142 Indeed, some rules have been revealed so that the Supreme Pen may not move in this revelation except to mention His lofty stations and His most beautiful view. When We wanted to show favor, We detailed it with the truth and lightened what We intended for you. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the Noble.

143 I have informed you before about what this Wise Reminder speaks. It says, the truthful word, "that it speaks in every matter that 'there is no god but Me, the Unique, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, the Aware.'"

This is a station that God has specifically assigned to this inaccessible, wondrous revelation. This is from the grace of God if you are among those who understand. This is from His definitive command, His greatest name, His highest word, and the rise of His most beautiful names if you are among the knowledgeable ones. Indeed, with it, the sunrises and the easts become visible. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed with truth, and contemplate on it, and do not be among the transgressors.

## Live Harmoniously With All Religions

144 Live harmoniously with all religions in a spirit of peace and goodwill, so that they may find in you a reflection of the Most Merciful. Beware that the fervor of ignorance does not take hold of you amongst the innocent. Every beginning is from God, and to Him it will return. Indeed, He is the Initiator of creation and the return of all worlds.

## Do Not Trespass In a House

145 Do not enter a house if its owner is absent, except with his permission. Always adhere to what is known to be right in all circumstances, and do not be among the heedless.

## Purify Wealth and Almsgiving

146 It has been decreed upon you to purify your wealth and everything below it through almsgiving (Zakat). This is the ruling that has been given from the Revealer of Verses in this formidable scripture. We will elaborate its specific amount for you if God wills and intends. Indeed, He details what He wills with knowledge from Him, for He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.

## Do Not Ask For Donations

147 Asking for donations is not permissible, and if someone does ask, it is forbidden for them to receive. It has been decreed for everyone to earn, and those who are incapable, it is for the trustees and the wealthy to provide what is sufficient for them. Follow God's limits and His traditions, then guard them as you would guard your own eyes. And do not be among the losers.

## Do Not Sadden Hearts and Souls

148 You are forbidden in the scripture from arguing, disputing, hitting, and similar actions that sadden the hearts and souls. If anyone causes sorrow to another, they must compensate with nineteen weights of gold. This is the ruling of the Master of the worlds. He has pardoned you in this appearance (revelation) and advises you to righteousness and piety, an order from Him in this enlightening tablet. Do not wish for anyone what you would not wish for yourself. Fear God and do not be among the arrogant. All of you were created from water and will return to the soil. Reflect on your consequences and do not be among the wrongdoers.

Listen to what the lote tree recites to you from the verses of God. Indeed, it is a criterion of guidance from God, the Lord of the hereafter and the first \[life\]. By it, souls fly to the source of revelation and the hearts of those facing \[God\] are illuminated. These are the boundaries of God, which are imposed on you. These are the orders of God, you are commanded to abide by them in the tablet. Act with spirit and fragrance; this is better for you if you are among those who understand.

## Recite the Verses of God Every Morning and Evening

149 Recite the verses of God every morning and evening. Indeed, he who does not recite does not fulfill the covenant of God and His pledge. And he who turns away from it today is indeed among those who turned away from God in the beginning of beginnings. Fear God, O my servants, all of you together.

Do not let the abundance of reading and deeds in the night and day deceive you. If one recites a verse from the verses with spirit and fragrance, it is better for him than to recite with laziness the scriptures of God, the Guardian, the Sustainer. Recite the verses of God to your capacity. Do not let laziness and sadness overcome you. Do not burden the souls with what makes them lethargic and heavy, but lighten them so that they may fly with the wings of the verses to the source of clarity. This is closer to God, if you understand.

## Teach Offspring to Read the Tablets in the Best of Melodies

150 Teach your offspring what has been revealed from the sky of majesty and power, so that they may read the tablets of the Merciful in the best of melodies in the built chambers in the east of remembrances.

Indeed, he who is pulled by the attraction of love to my name, the Merciful, indeed, he recites the verses of God in such a way that it attracts the hearts of the sleeping ones. Blessed is he who drinks the nectar of life from the statement of his Lord, the Merciful, by this name that has blown away every shining, elevated mountain.

## Renew Foundations of the House Every Nineteen Years

151 It has been decreed upon you to renew the foundations of the house after the lapse of nineteen years. Thus, the matter has been decided by the all-knowing, all-aware one. He wished to make things easier for you and what you possess. Be mindful of God and do not be among the heedless. And for the one who is not able, God has pardoned him. Indeed, He is the most forgiving, the most generous.

## Wash Your Feet

152 Wash your feet every day in the summer, and during the winter, once every three days.

## Respond to Anger With Gentleness

153 If someone is angry with you, respond to them with gentleness. If someone rebukes you, do not rebuke them in return. Leave them to their own devices and place your trust in God, the just avenger, the almighty.

## Prohibited From Ascending Pulpits

154 You are prohibited from ascending to pulpits. If someone wishes to recite the verses of their Lord to you, let them sit on a chair placed on a platform and mention God, their Lord and the Lord of the worlds. God has preferred your seating on platforms and chairs, honoring what you have of love for God and the source of His radiant command.

## Gambling and Opium Forbidden

155 Gambling and opium are forbidden to you. Avoid them, O assembly of creation, and do not be among those who transgress. Beware of using anything that dulls your faculties and harms your bodies. We desire nothing for you but what is beneficial to you. Everything testifies to this if you would but listen.

## Respond to Invitations for Banquets and Gatherings with Joy

156 When you are invited to banquets and gatherings, respond with joy and cheerfulness. Those who fulfill their promises are safe from threats. This is a day in which every wise matter is detailed.

## Secret of Reversal

157 The secret of reversal has been revealed for the symbol of the chief. Blessed is he whom God has supported to acknowledge the six, which have risen with this standing 'Alif'. Surely, he is from the sincere ones. How many devout people have turned away, and how many neglectful ones have turned towards, and said to You, "Praise be to You, O Ultimate Goal of the worlds". Indeed, the matter is in the hands of God, He gives to whom He wills what He wills, and He withholds from whom He wills what He wills. He knows what is hidden in the hearts and what the eyes of the scrutinizers move towards.

How many heedless ones have sincerely turned towards us, we have seated them on the bed of acceptance, and how many wise ones we have returned to the fire, as a matter of justice from us, indeed we have been judges. Surely, He is the Manifest, God does what He wills, and the One established on the throne rules as He wishes.

## The Knowledge of Meanings

158 Blessed is he who has found the knowledge of meanings from the trace of this pen, which when moves, the breath of God is spread in what is beyond it, and when it stops, the essence of tranquility appears in the places. Exalted is the Most Merciful, the manifestor of this great favor. Say: with what the darkness carried, the back of justice appeared in what is beyond it, and with what accepted the humiliation, the honor of God shone between the worlds.

## Carrying Weapons of War, Adorn Yourself with Manners and Ethics

159 It is forbidden for you to carry weapons of war except in times of necessity, and it is permissible for you to wear silk. God has lifted from you the rule of limitation in dress and beard, as a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing Commander. Do what is not condemned by upright minds, and do not make yourselves a playground for the ignorant. Blessed is the one who adorns himself with the embroidery of manners and ethics, indeed he is among those who supported his Lord with clear and manifest deeds.

## Melodies in the Houses of God

160 Construct the houses of God and His lands, then remember Him therein with the melodies of those drawn near. Indeed, hearts are built by the tongue, just as houses and dwellings are built by hand and other means. We have predetermined a cause for everything from Us. Hold on to it and rely on the Wise, the All-Knowing.

## The Foundation of Beliefs

161 Blessed is the one who affirms God and His signs and acknowledges that He is not questioned about what He does. This word, God has made it the foundation of beliefs and its root, and by it, the work of the workers is accepted. Make this word before your eyes so that the signs of those who turn away do not cause you to stumble.

162 If what was forbidden from time immemorial becomes lawful, or vice versa, no one has the right to object to it. And he who stops at anything less than this, indeed, he is among the transgressors.

163 And he who has not attained this supreme foundation and the highest station is swayed by the winds of doubt and is turned about by the sayings of the idolaters. He who attains this foundation has indeed achieved the greatest rectitude. How excellent is this most glorious station which, by its mention, adorns every impregnable tablet.

Thus, Allah teaches you what delivers you from doubt and confusion and saves you in this world and the hereafter. Indeed, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Generous. He is the one who sent the messengers and revealed the books, asserting that there is no deity except Him, the Mighty, the Wise.

## To the Land of Kaf and Ra

164 O land of Kaf and Ra, indeed we see you in a state which Allah does not love, and we observe from you what no one else perceives except Allah, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware. And we find what flows from you in the secret of secrets, in our possession is the knowledge of all things in a clear tablet. Do not grieve over this, for Allah will soon make manifest in you champions of great might who remember Me steadfastly, not deterred by the signs of the scholars nor obscured by the doubts of the suspicious ones.

These are the ones who gaze upon Allah with their own eyes and support Him with their very selves. Verily, they are those firmly grounded in truth.

## To the Community of Scholars

### Do Not Cause Corruption

165 O community of scholars, when the verses were revealed and the clear proofs appeared, we saw you behind the veils. This is indeed a matter of wonder. You have taken pride in My name and neglected My essence. When the Merciful came with the argument and the proof, We broke through the veils. Beware of veiling the people with another veil. Break the chains of illusions in the name of the Sovereign of Mankind and do not be among the deceivers. When you turn towards Allah and enter this matter, do not cause corruption therein, nor measure Allah's book by your desires. This is the advice of Allah before and after. The witnesses of Allah and His chosen ones bear witness to this. Verily, we all are witnesses to it.

166 Remember the elder who was named Muhammad, before Hassan, and he was among the most knowledgeable scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and his likes turned away from it, and those who separated the wheat from the barley turned to Allah. He, on his claim, wrote down the laws of Allah night and day. But when the Chosen One came, not a letter of it benefited him. If it had benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face which illuminated the faces of the close ones. If you had believed in Allah at the time of His manifestation, people would not have turned away from Him and what you see happening today would not have been reported to us. Fear Allah and do not be among the heedless.

### Do Not Let Names Deter You From Their Owner

167 Beware that you do not let names deter you from their Owner, or let remembrance obscure this Wise Remembrance. Seek refuge in Allah, O assembly of scholars, and do not make yourselves a veil between me and my creation. Thus, Allah admonishes you and commands you to be just, lest your deeds become void while you are unaware. The one who turned away from this matter, can he affirm a truth in innovation? No, for he is the Master of invention, but people are in a clear veil. Say, with this, the sun of the proof has risen, and the light of the evidence has appeared to those in the realm. Fear Allah, O people of insight, and do not deny. Beware lest the mention of the Prophet prevent you from this Greater News, or the guardianship prevent the Guardianship of Allah, the Protector over all the worlds.

Every name has been created by His word, and every matter is tied to His command, the Executor, the Mighty, the Innovator. Say, this is the Day of Allah, in which only His Dominant Self is mentioned over all the worlds. This matter has disturbed what you have of illusions and images.

### Don't Use the Book and Use it as Evidence Against Allah

168 We see among you those who take the book and use it as evidence against Allah, just as every community used its book as evidence against Allah, the Dominant, the Sustainer. Say, by Allah, the truth is that today, the books of the world and what they contain of scriptures will not benefit you, except for this book which speaks at the axis of creation, affirming that there is no god but I, the All-Knowing, the Wise.

### Unite People

169 O assembly of scholars, beware of becoming the cause of disagreement among the masses, just as you were the reason for their turning away at the beginning. Unite the people around this statement by which the pebbles proclaimed 'the Kingdom belongs to Allah, the source of the signs'. Thus Allah advises you out of His grace. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.

170 Remember the noble one whom we invited to Allah. Indeed, he was arrogant, following his whims after we sent him the proof that pleased the eye. Thus, Allah's argument was completed upon everyone in the heavens and the earths. We commanded him to approach with grace from the Rich, the Exalted, but he turned his back until the punishers of torment seized him, by Allah's justice. Indeed, we were witnesses.

171 We tore apart the veils so that the inhabitants of the kingdom might hear the sound of their tearing. This is the command of Allah from before and hereafter. Blessed are those who act upon what is commanded, and woe to the neglectful.

172 We only intended in the realm of sovereignty to manifest God and His authority, and God is sufficient as a witness over me. We only intended in the celestial sphere to elevate the command of God and His praise, and God is sufficient as my guardian. We only intended in the realm of omnipotence to mention God and what descended from Him, and God is sufficient as my helper.

## Blessings for the Assembly of Scholars in Splendor

173 Blessed are you, O assembly of scholars, in splendor! By God, you are the waves of the greatest sea, the stars of the sky of grace, and the banners of victory between the heavens and the earth. You are the sources of rectitude among creation and the dawns of clarity for all those who can comprehend. Blessed is the one who turns towards you, and woe to those who turn away. Today, it is fitting for the one who has drunk the nectar of life from the hand of his most kind and merciful Lord to become as vital as the artery in the body of existence, so that the world may be stirred by him and every decayed bone reanimated.

## Return What You Did Not Understand To the Branch

174 O people of creation, when the leaves flutter away from the tree of praise, and head towards the most remote and hidden destination, return what you did not understand from the Book to the branch that branches out from this upright origin.

## The Supreme Pen Moves Only By Permission From the Lord

175 O Supreme Pen, move across the Tablet by the permission of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Then remember when the source of monotheism, the office of abstraction, was desired. Perhaps the free will glimpse the capacity of the needle's syringe with what is behind the curtains of your Lord's secrets, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say, indeed, we entered the office of meanings and clarification when those in existence were unaware. We witnessed what the Merciful descended and accepted what He gifted to me from the signs of God, the Guardian, the Everlasting. We heard what He testified in the Tablet. Indeed, we were witnesses. We fulfilled it by a command from us. Indeed, we were commanders.

## To the Eloquent Assembly (People of the Bayan)

176 O eloquent assembly, indeed, we entered the office of God when you were asleep, and we observed the Tablet when you were slumbering. By God, the truth, we read it before its descent while you were unaware. We comprehended the book when you were in the loins. This is my remembrance according to your measure, not according to God's measure. What is in God's knowledge testifies to this if you but knew, and the tongue of God testifies to this if you but understood. By God, if the veil were lifted, you would be struck dumb.

### Beware Arguing About God

177 Beware of arguing about God and His command. He has become apparent in such a manner that He encompasses what has been and what will be. If we speak in this place with the tongue of the celestial beings, we would say, God created that office before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and we entered it before the letter "kaf" was combined with its cornerstone, the "nun" \[Arabic letters\].

This is the language of my servants in my kingdom. Reflect on what the tongue of the beings of my dominion speaks, with the knowledge we have taught them from Us, and what was hidden in the knowledge of God, and what the tongue of greatness and power speaks in its praiseworthy position.

178 This is not a matter to play with your illusions, and this is not a place where every coward and deluded one can enter. By God, this is a track of disclosure and detachment, and a field of observation and elevation. Only the knights of the Merciful, who have discarded their capabilities, can wander here. They are the supporters of God on earth and the sources of power among all the worlds.

### Beware Allowing What is in the Explanation from Preventing You from you Lord

179 Beware of allowing what is in the explanation to prevent you from your Merciful Lord. By God, it was indeed sent down for my remembrance if you only knew. The sincere ones find in it nothing but the recognition of my love and my name, the Supreme Witness over all things seen and unseen. Say, O people, turn your attention to what was sent down from my highest pen. If you find in it the knowledge of God, do not object to it and do not prevent yourselves from God's bounty and His subtleties. Thus, God advises you, for He is indeed the Wise Advisor.

### Ask God What You Do Not Understand

180 What you do not understand from the explanation, ask God, your Lord, and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Indeed, if He wills, He can clarify for you what was sent down in it and what was hidden in the sea of His words from the precious jewels of knowledge and wisdom. Indeed, He is the Supreme Authority over the names. There is no god but He, the Supreme Authority, the Sustainer.

## This Greatest Composition

181 This greatest composition has stirred up the rhythm, and this marvelous order, which no eye of creativity has witnessed its likeness, has brought about a change in the arrangement.

## The Religion of God, Before and After

182 Immerse yourselves in the ocean of my explanations, perhaps you will uncover from it the pearls of wisdom and mysteries. Beware that you do not hesitate in this matter, through which the sovereignty and power of God have appeared. Hasten to it with bright faces. This is the religion of God, before and after. Whoever desires, let him accept, and whoever does not, indeed, God is free from need of the worlds.

183 Say: This is the balance of guidance for those in the heavens and the earth, and the greatest proof if you but knew. Say: With it, every argument is established in the ages if you but have certainty.

## To You Who Turns Away (Mirza Yahya)

184 Say, O you who turns away, leave your preoccupations, then speak the truth among creation. By God, my tears have flowed on my cheeks for seeing you turning towards your whims and turning away from the One who created you and fashioned you. Remember the favor of your Lord when He nurtured you through nights and days for the sake of His cause. Fear God and be among those who repent. Has your matter become unclear to people, is it unclear to yourself as well? Hide from God, then remember when you were standing before the Throne and you wrote what We revealed to you from the signs of God, the Dominant, the Able, the Powerful.

### Turn to Him and He Will Forgive You

Beware that your passion doesn't prevent you from acknowledging the unity of God. Turn to Him and do not fear your actions, for He forgives whomever He wills out of His grace. There is no god but He, the Forgiving, the Generous. We only advise you for the sake of God. If you accept, it's for your own benefit, and if you turn away, indeed, your Lord is free from need of you and those who follow you out of clear delusion. God has taken from those who led you astray, so return to Him humbly, submissively, and with utter humility. Indeed, He will erase your misdeeds. Indeed, your Lord is the Repentant, the Mighty, the Merciful.

## The Advice, Grace, and Remembrance of God

185 This is the advice of God, if you are among those who listen. This is the grace of God, if you are among those who accept. This is the remembrance of God, if you are among those who perceive. This is the treasure of God, if you are among those who know.

## This Book Has Become The Lamp For the World

186 This is a book that has become the lamp for the world's path and its straightest way among the worlds. Say, indeed, it is the source of God's knowledge if you know, and the sunrise of God's commands if you understand.

## Do Not Burden Animals With What They Cannot Bear

187 Do not burden the animals with what they cannot bear. We have strictly forbidden you from this in the Book. Be the embodiments of justice and fairness between the heavens and the earths.

## Penalty For Unintentionally Killing a Person

188 Whoever kills a person unintentionally, there is an indemnity for it to be paid to his family, and it is a hundred weights of gold. Act according to what you have been commanded in the Tablet, and do not be among the transgressors.

## To People of the Councils In the Lands

### Choose a Language and Script, a Cause of Unity

189 O people of the councils in the lands, choose a language from the languages to be spoken on earth and so too from the scripts. Indeed, God clarifies for you what benefits you and makes you self-sufficient from others. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the All-Knowing, the Well-Informed. This is the cause of unity if you know, and the major reason for agreement and civilization if you feel. We have made these two matters as signs for reaching the first world, which is the greatest foundation. We revealed it in other tablets, and the second one was revealed in this extraordinary tablet.

## Consumption of Opium is Forbidden

190 The consumption of opium has been made forbidden to you. We have emphatically prohibited it in the Scripture. Whoever consumes it, verily, they are not from Me. Be mindful of God, O people of understanding.
