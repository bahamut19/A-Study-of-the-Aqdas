## From One Comes Many, From Many Comes One

Unity is a surprisingly complex idea. I sometimes feel unity is defined by many as meaning sameness, like an orchestra of clarinets each playing the same melody. It might seem good in theory, but in implementation is a highly unnatural arrangement which no person would pay to attend nor critically acclaim. To others unity means a minority should submit to the will of the majority, merely so there is no conflict. This would be like an orchestra where the clarinets outnumber the horns and are in front of microphones. The horns are not allowed any contribution and once again, it would not be an arrangement anyone would want to be a part of.

Instead, the Bab opens the Bayan with a different vision of unity derived from the name of God, the One:

> The names and attributes are manifestations of the multiplicity of that primal unity. Reflect upon the verbal letters of the Bay√°n: all multiplicity originates from the first unity, even if it extends infinitely. And in the multiplicity of the universal manifestations, there arises a strength in the manifestation surpassing that of the primal unity. Yet, all things are realized through Him, and all return to Him, just as they originate from Him.[^unity-1]

[^unity-1]: The Persian Bayan Vahid 3 Gate 10

If I had to summarize this theme here and elsewhere in the Bayan or the teachings of Baha'u'llah, it would be that from One comes many, and many returns to One. It is the very essence of the Bab being called the Primal Point.

## Unity in the Names of God

In Chapter 1, we explored the various names and attributes of God. With God being One, all the other names are multiplied. They describe various attributes and these names exist in thousands of languages, which are also derived from one tongue and one breath. All of these names and attributes eventually return to the point of Oneness.

## Unity in the Worlds of God

In Chapter 3, we explored the various worlds of God. Within a single creation, everything seen and unseen was multiplied. There are infinite worlds and planes of existence. Yet, when creation is ready to be made new, it is rolled all into one.[^unity-2] All of these worlds eventually return to the point of Oneness.

## Unity in the Spiritual Practices

Throughout Chapters 8-12, we explored the various spiritual practices. From one soul are multiple pathways for the soul to be more fully expressed, while exploring not only the multiplicity of the names, attributes, and worlds of God, but also exploring the essential unity underlying it all. From one God are a multiplication of souls throughout the world, and from this multiplication of souls comes One. All souls return to God.

If any of these spiritual practices are neglected, the ability for the soul to achieve its own internal unity is severely compromised. Unity must be achieved within us before unity can be expressed outwardly. Unity cannot be imposed from the outside. It first must be composed from the inside.

## Unity in the Virtues

We also explored several virtues. With God being the essence of all virtue, these virtues are the lights guiding each of us. For example, from one light of trustworthiness can come multiple expressions of trustworthiness, and from these multiple expressions of trustworthiness can we return to the source of all virtue.

All these virtues are like stars of a greater constellation. The constellation itself can be called Unity. When all the stars are within view, they are all interconnected and work as One. If one virtue shines too strongly, there is risk nearby stars cannot be seen. The constellation is broken. If one virtue is never developed, the constellation is also broken. The stars may not shine equally at all times, but they must all be seen in order for the constellation of unity to form. The constellation

The shape of the constellation may be seen differently. One constellation may appear as a Scorpio while to another, it may appear as an Orion. These ways to interpret what we see can be limitless, as our experiences are unique, our souls are unique, and our place in the spiritual worlds may always be in a unique position. From these multitudes of constellations of unity return to one, which is also unity. These constellations will be seen by others. These constellations are the evidence of sincere belief, being signs of the spirit of God for those who seek God.

As we see, unity is not sameness. Instead, it is like a well-rehearsed orchestra with hundreds of instruments. These instruments play different melodies, different notes, different tones, yet harmonize into the most beautiful sound ever heard. This harmonized sound passes through one ear, and it is heard and felt. This is unity.

## Unity in the Kitab-i-Aqdas

When the Kitab-i-Aqdas commands us to recognize the Manifestation of God for this age, this is the foundation of all unity. You are committing yourself to belief in God, the worlds of God, the revelations of God, and all Manifestations of God. You are committing yourself to various spiritual practices and the development of your inner virtues. You are committing yourself to the liberation of your soul. You are also committing yourself to the liberation of souls near to you. These commitments can only arise through a commitment to unity, to the Oneness of God, to the essential Oneness of everything.

The Kitab-i-Aqdas is a book of unity. Because of this, as we proceed from belief and spiritual practice to practical application, be are constantly reminded of this essential unity. Every law, counsel, boundary, and exhortation exists for unity. Unity is the path of glory. Unity is the path of liberation.

However, if we attempt to achieve unity without the entire Book guiding us, unity becomes a mere illusion. If unity is the only virtue, goal, or law, the religion of God becomes a deadly weapon which oppresses the souls God desires to liberate.

The Kitab-i-Aqdas is not a book of sameness. While it prescribes the same Book to all, how the Book is expressed will have infinite forms. This is by design. From these infinite forms, from each and every one of us, we have the opportunity to all walk a singular path of unity.
