## No Manifestation For 1,000 Years

Baha'u'llah says that whoever declares a proclamation before 1,000 years has expired is an imposter. The Kitab-i-Aqdas was first written in 1873, so this could mean at least by the year 2873. The proclamation would include a command of new revelation which could change the law of God. This also ensures there is a duration in the implementation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas to allow for the development of the nations.

Anyone who makes such a proclamation without later repenting will be punished severely by God. No one else has any authority to punish such a person.

## Ridván

All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the first day of Ridván, when We manifested to those in existence with Our most beautiful names and highest attributes. This is from My bounty which has encompassed the worlds, so that you may associate with the followers of other religions and proclaim the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful.

## We Are With You

Baha'u'llah and the Manifestations will be with you in all conditions, even when He is no longer physically among you. He will assist you with the truth.

There is wisdom in His appearance and there is another wisdom in His concealment.
