## No Manifestation For 1,000 Years

Baha'u'llah says that whoever declares a proclamation before 1,000 years has expired is an imposter. The Kitab-i-Aqdas was first written in 1873, so this could mean at least by the year 2873. The proclamation would include a command of new revelation which could change the law of God. This also ensures there is a duration in the implementation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas to allow for the development of the nations.

Anyone who makes such a proclamation without later repenting will be punished severely by God. No one else has any authority to punish such a person.

## We Are With You

Baha'u'llah and the Manifestations will be with you in all conditions, even when He is no longer physically among you. He will assist you with the truth.

## Informs of What is Hidden
