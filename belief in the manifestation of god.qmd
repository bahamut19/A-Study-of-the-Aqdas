## No Manifestation For 1,000 Years

Baha'u'llah says that whoever declares a proclamation before 1,000 years has expired is an imposter. The Kitab-i-Aqdas was first written in 1873, so this could mean at least by the year 2873. The proclamation would include a command of new revelation which could change the law of God. This also ensures there is a duration in the implementation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas to allow for the development of the nations.

Anyone who makes such a proclamation without later repenting will be punished severely by God. No one else has any authority to punish such a person.

## Ridván

All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the first day of Ridván, when We manifested to those in existence with Our most beautiful names and highest attributes. This is from My bounty which has encompassed the worlds, so that you may associate with the followers of other religions and proclaim the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful.

## We Are With You

Baha'u'llah and the Manifestations will be with you in all conditions, even when He is no longer physically among you. He will assist you with the truth.

There is wisdom in His appearance and there is another wisdom in His concealment.

## Sacred Houses

## The Upright 'Alif

The six (Vav) have been exalted by the upright 'Alif.

## The Mystery of Inversion

How many ascetics have turned away, and how many renunciants have come forward, proclaiming, "Praise be unto You, O Desired One of the worlds!" The matter is in the hands of God; He bestows upon whomsoever He wills whatever He wills, and withholds from whomsoever He wills whatever He desires. He knows the secrets of hearts and the glances of the scoffers. How many heedless souls have approached with purity, and We have seated them upon the throne of acceptance. And how many learned ones have We returned to the fire, as an act of justice on Our part.

## Judge

## Chief

## My Herald (The Bab)

He said, if you attain what We reveal, you will ask from the grace of God for Him to reign upon your innermost selves, for that is a glory beyond reach. For Him to drink a cup of water with you is greater than for every soul to drink of His own existence, indeed greater than all things. O My servants, if only you could perceive.

### He Whom God Shall Make Manifest

## Breeze of My Mercy

Dominates all the worlds

## Sweet Fragrances

The sweet fragrances of the Most Glorious One dominates all the worlds

## Most Great Sight

## The Intended Purpose

Whoever has known Me has known the intended purpose

## Why The Command Changes

### Example: Marriage Law

Then consider what has been revealed in another station, that you might abandon what you possess, turning toward God, the Lord of the worlds. He said that marriage is not lawful unless it is according to the Bayán, and that if one enters, the other is forbidden from claiming ownership of what belongs to them unless it is returned after the matter is raised up to Him Whom God shall make manifest in truth or to that which has appeared with justice. Before this, you should draw near, that you may by this raise up the command of God. Thus has the Dove sung upon the branches in remembrance of her Lord, the Merciful. Blessed are those who listen.

## Most Glorious Reminder

There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” This is a station God has designated for this most wondrous, most exalted Revelation.
