## Cleanliness

Wash whatever has been covered by dust and how much more so of encrusted dirt and filth beneath it.

## Refinement

If you are able to, renew the furnishings of your house every 19 years. He desires bringing ease and refinement to you and what you possess. If you are unable, they are pardoned by God.
