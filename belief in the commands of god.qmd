## Command of God Before and After

This is the command of God, before and after, and with it He has adorned the scriptures of former generations. This is the mention of God, before and after, with which He has embroidered the fabric of the Book of Existence, if you are of those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after.

If He permits what was forbidden in the eternal past, or forbids what was permitted, no one has the right to object to Him.
