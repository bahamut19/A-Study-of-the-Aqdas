1.  Islamic Jurisprudence

2.  Islamic Theology

3.  Islamic Exegesis

4.  Philosophy, such as Peripatetic and Illuminationism

5.  Mysticism

7.  Astronomy

8.  Astrology

9.  Logic, Aristotelian

## Baha'u'llah Weeps

The eye of My favor weeps for you, for you have not recognized the One whom you call upon in the evening and at dawn, at every sunset and daybreak
