## A Clamor In Every Land

## The Throne of Istanbul

It will perish

Daughters and Widows will weep

Tribes among you will weep. Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Greeks, Armenians, Sephardic Jews, Romaniote Jews, Albanians, Circassians, Bosniaks, Levantines. Palestine?

## Blood on the Banks of the Rhine

We have seen you covered with blood, as the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and again you shall have it.

## Lamentation of Berlin

We hear the lamentation of Berlin, though she is now in manifest glory.

## Judgment of Tehran by the Masses

Things will be overturned. The masses will judge you.

Tranquility will follow the turmoil.
