title: "Appendix 9: A Structural Map of the Worlds of God"
number-sections: false

This appendix provides a reference framework for the terms used throughout this book when discussing the worlds of God. These terms describe relationships, functions, and stations of existence rather than physical locations or spatial realms. The purpose of this appendix is clarity and consistency, allowing readers to orient themselves without interrupting the narrative flow of the main chapters.

## Worlds of God

The worlds of God are broad realms of existence beyond the material world. They represent levels of reality and meaning through which the soul journeys. Although not necessarily perceptible in a physical or spatial sense, these worlds are real and serve as the context for spiritual growth, transformation, and continuation beyond earthly life.

## Kingdoms

Kingdoms are domains within the worlds of God associated with divine attributes. A kingdom may reflect an attribute such as Justice, Mercy, Knowledge, Power, or Command. Engagement with a kingdom shapes how an attribute is understood, experienced, and expressed by the soul as it matures.

## Cities

Cities are shared spaces of meaning or experience within a kingdom. A city represents a collective context in which souls encounter similar conditions, lessons, or spiritual realities. Cities emphasize the relational and communal dimensions of spiritual existence rather than isolation or individualism.

## Schools

Schools are contexts of learning and maturation within a city. They represent processes through which the soul acquires understanding, refinement, discipline, or detachment. Progress through schools is not uniform and depends on the soul’s capacity, receptivity, and spiritual condition.

## The Celestial Concourse

The Celestial Concourse refers to the gathering or communion of exalted souls and divine realities. It reflects unity, harmony, and cooperation in service to the will of God. The Concourse is not confined to a single world or kingdom but participates across realms of existence.

## Angels

Angels are beings or realities associated with divine action, guidance, and the execution of God’s will. They may be understood as forces, perfected souls, or expressions of divine attributes in action. Angels are not necessarily bound to anthropomorphic form or physical limitation.

## Sidrat al-Muntahá (The Lote-Tree)

The Sidrat al-Muntahá represents the boundary at which created knowledge reaches its limit. It marks the meeting point between the created worlds and divine Revelation. Beyond this horizon lies that which cannot be fully grasped or comprehended by created beings.

## The Mother Book

The Mother Book is the source from which divine knowledge and Revelation proceed. It represents divine order, coherence, and originating wisdom. Access to the Mother Book is mediated through Revelation rather than independent human inquiry.

## The Holy Spirit and the Holy Maiden

The Holy Spirit and the Holy Maiden are expressions of divine inspiration, communication, and life-giving influence. They serve as intermediaries through which Revelation, guidance, and confirmation are conveyed to creation. These realities emphasize God’s active and sustaining presence within the worlds of God.
