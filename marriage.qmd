title: "Marriage"
---

**Focus:** The spiritual and legal dimensions of marriage

-   

-   Marriage as a right and responsibility

-   

-   Role of parental consent and harmony

-   

-   Partnership, not hierarchy

-   

-   Rights within the marriage (inheritance, fidelity, support, consultation)

-   

-   Optional mention of spiritual divorce as a mercy, not punishment

-   

Frame marriage as a **spiritual covenant**, not a contract.
