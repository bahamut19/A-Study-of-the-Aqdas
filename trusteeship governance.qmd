## About a King Who Supports Baha'u'llah's Cause

It is fitting for everyone to honor, revere, and assist him, that he may conquer cities with the keys of My Name, the One Who rules over all in the realms of the unseen and the seen.

Support him with wealth and lives.

## Exhortation to Believers

No one should object to those who rule over the people. Leave them to what they have and turn towards the hearts.
