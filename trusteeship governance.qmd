title: "Trusteeship Governance"
---

Trusteeship governance is what I am calling Baha'u'llah's vision for a constitutional monarchy government. It could follow closely to the British parliamentary system under the rule of Queen Victoria. While Baha'u'llah in the Lawh-i-Dunya said the British system is good due to combining both kingship and consultation, it lacked the fear of God. This would be a deficiency which ultimately limits the moral authority of any political order.

The Kitab-i-Aqdas also commands us to support a monarch who arises to serve the Cause of God.[^trusteeship-governance-1] Everyone must honor, revere, and assist them. The assistance is not symbolic. Our support is with our wealth and our lives. When we combine everything read within the Kitab-i-Aqdas and throughout Baha'u'llah's teachings, it is inescapable a key part of the liberation of souls is to be active at every level of society. Our role is not to wait for institutions to mature, nor to assume people who do not believe in Baha'u'llah will figure things out. We have the responsibility for our deeds to match our words, ideals, and beliefs.

[^trusteeship-governance-1]: Kitab-i-Aqds #84

This chapter will describe what I feel is the ideal of what trusteeship governance is and what it entails. While I am an optimist, I am also aware we will need to know the pathway which leads towards that ideal. As you proceed, I do want to remind this chapter is entirely interpretive. I invite you to continue exploring Baha'u'llah's writings and see how your understanding of these topics relate.

## The Roles, Responsibilities, and Rights of Government

### Legislative

The Houses of Justice consult on any new laws. They determine penalties, funding, budgets, and describe how a law will be enforced. In the absence of a House of Justice with the 5th level of authority granted, the people of the nation serve this capacity. The members serving are not immune to the laws they pass, and have no additional rights.

Any declaration of war submitted by the diplomatic branch must be approved by the House of Justice before being declared.

### Judicial

The Houses of Justice consult on the application of penalties, and the fair application of the law. They also advise on any potential changes to the Constitution, such as additional rights, potential risks to citizen's rights, and oversight of the executive branch. Where Houses of Justice serve both Legislative and Judicial functions, no member can serve both roles.

### Executive

The executive would be an elected position whose purpose is to execute and administer the domestic laws set forth by the Houses of Justice. They are to protect the people from internal threats.

### Diplomatic

The diplomatic branch would be responsible for all foreign relationships. Any treaty or agreement must be adjudicated by a House of Justice through consultation. They are also tasked to ensure the safety of the nation and its people from external threats. There is no right to secrecy except in times of declared war.

### Monarch

The monarch serves a lifetime appointment unless removed by the Judicial branch for a crime committed. The monarch has the ability to call constitutional conventions to secure the rights of citizens, or to redefine the roles of the government other than their own. They can submit items for the House of Justice to consult on. Finally, the monarch oversees the lower-level jurisdictions and ensures their constitutionality.

### The Constitution

The constitution offers no additional rights for any person who serves in government. All rights described in the chapters of the books are to be protected. The constitution will also describe the nation's relationship to lower jurisdictions, who also would follow this above format. The exception is the diplomatic branch of lower levels would not be tasked with external safety, although they would still be tasked with external relationships.

This means at the formative city level, you may have a city monarch, a mayor and their executive functions, a city diplomat which works with neighboring cities on common goals and problem resolution, a system of judges, and a legislative branch for ordinances, taxation, and budgets.

All levels of government must be transparent, such as with their funding, meetings, and agreements. Selection for leaders and subordinates will be determined by the constitution. The constitution defines the maximum levels of taxation and the minimum percent of funding which goes towards social welfare. Last but not least, the constitutions describe the trusteeship model of witness, trustee, and helper for every branch and level of responsibility. There must never be any doubt about a leader's role as a trustee, instead of for other purposes.

There are other considerations and many details to include within this brief framework. This vision is one way to apply the teachings of Baha'u'llah. What do you envision?

## Chapter 26

## Trusteeship Governance

### *From Authority to Trust*

### 26.1 Purpose of This Chapter

**Why Trusteeship Governance Matters Now**

-   Clarify that this chapter does **not** introduce new teachings

-   Explain its role as a *convergence point* for:

    -   Individual responsibility (Parts 1–3)

    -   Community life

    -   Leadership, justice, and power

-   Reframe governance not as domination or administration, but as **entrusted responsibility**

-   Emphasize that Bahá’u’lláh’s vision assumes:

    -   Moral maturity

    -   Spiritual agency

    -   Accountability without infallible intermediaries

### 26.2 The Core Principle: Trusteeship, Not Rule

-   Define **trusteeship** as:

    -   Temporary

    -   Conditional

    -   Accountable

    -   Revocable

-   Contrast trusteeship with:

    -   Absolute authority

    -   Clerical control

    -   Ideological governance

-   Establish that **all power is derivative**:

    -   From God

    -   Through conscience

    -   Answerable to justice

Key idea:

> No one *owns* authority. Authority is *held* on behalf of others.

### 26.3 The Architecture of a Trusteeship-Based Society

**What Governance Looks Like**

This section describes the *shape* of governance, not a rigid system.

#### 26.3.1 Individual Level

-   Every person as a trustee of:

    -   Their conscience

    -   Their actions

    -   Their private self

-   Rights and responsibilities as inseparable

-   Spiritual practices as the *foundation* of public trust

#### 26.3.2 Community Level

-   Communities as moral ecosystems, not bureaucracies

-   Governance arising from:

    -   Trust

    -   Consultation

    -   Shared responsibility

-   Emphasis on:

    -   Social health

    -   Belonging

    -   Mutual care

-   Communities are not “managed” — they are *cultivated*

#### 26.3.3 Houses of Justice (Properly Understood)

-   Defined by function, not supremacy

-   Roles:

    -   Arbitration

    -   Stewardship of collective welfare

    -   Protection of rights

-   Explicit rejection of:

    -   Infallibility

    -   Centralized absolutism

    -   Permanent elite status

-   Houses exist *for the people*, not above them

### 26.4 Leadership Without Clergy

**Who Leads, and How**

-   Distinction between:

    -   Authority

    -   Influence

    -   Wisdom

-   Roles in a trusteeship society:

    -   Scholars (interpreters, not rulers)

    -   Elders (moral anchors, not enforcers)

    -   Servant-leaders (temporary, accountable)

-   No priesthood

-   No exclusive access to truth

-   Leadership emerges through:

    -   Trust earned

    -   Character demonstrated

    -   Service rendered

### 26.5 Governance and the State

**Relationship to Civil Authority**

-   Trusteeship governance does not require:

    -   Theocracy

    -   Religious coercion

    -   A global religious state

-   Compatible with:

    -   Constitutional monarchy

    -   Representative democracy

    -   City-state or federated models

-   The role of religion:

    -   Moral compass

    -   Cultural influence

    -   Source of restraint on power

-   The state governs bodies; conscience remains free

### 26.6 Economics as Trusteeship

-   Wealth as a trust, not entitlement

-   Economic life guided by:

    -   Justice

    -   Moderation

    -   Responsibility

-   No enforced equality

-   No sanctification of exploitation

-   Voluntary systems (zakát, huqúq, stewardship) as moral correctives

-   Markets remain—but conscience governs participation

### 26.7 How We Get There

**Evolution, Not Revolution**

-   Reject sudden transformation narratives

-   Trusteeship governance emerges through:

    -   Moral maturity

    -   Education

    -   Practice of virtues

-   Stages of development:

    1.  Individual integrity

    2.  Healthy families

    3.  Trust-based communities

    4.  Local governance rooted in justice

    5.  Gradual societal alignment

-   Failure, correction, and humility are expected parts of the process

### 26.8 The Role of the Individual Today

**What You Are Already Responsible For**

-   You are already a trustee:

    -   Of truth

    -   Of justice

    -   Of your influence

-   Governance begins in:

    -   Speech

    -   Relationships

    -   Private decisions

-   No waiting for institutions to “be ready”

-   The future is shaped by:

    -   Daily ethical choices

    -   Courage to resist unjust power

    -   Refusal to outsource conscience

### 26.9 Safeguards Against Corruption

-   No unchecked authority

-   Transparency as a moral requirement

-   Consultation as a corrective, not a ritual

-   Removal of leaders as a sign of health, not failure

-   Community trust as the ultimate metric of legitimacy

### 26.10 The Future Vision

**A World Governed by Trust**

-   Power restrained by conscience

-   Leadership rooted in service

-   Law aligned with moral purpose

-   Diversity preserved within unity

-   No religious empire—only a shared ethical horizon

Closing emphasis:

> Trusteeship governance is not imposed from above.\
> It is grown from within.

If you’d like, next we can:

-   Tighten this into **publication-ready prose**

-   Align it explicitly with **earlier chapters by cross-reference**

-   Draft a **closing paragraph for the entire book**

-   Or stress-test this model against historical or modern governance systems

This chapter has the potential to be the *quiet center of gravity* for everything you’ve written.
