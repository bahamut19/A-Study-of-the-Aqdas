## Cleanliness

Hold fast to the cord of cleanliness so that no traces of dirt are seen on your garments. For those who have an excuse, there is no blame on them.

Purify every disliked thing with water whose essential properties have not changed. Water is a religious symbol for purifying.

Beware of using water that has been altered by air or other substance.

God has removed the law of impurity from all things and from other religions as a gift from God. All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the first day of Ridv√°n.

Immerse your bodies in fresh water that completely surrounds you every week, and to cleanse your bodies with what you have previously used. Used water is not allowed. Do not use Persian baths.

Pouring water over oneself and washing the body is sufficient and preferable, and spares you from immersion. He has willed to ease matters for you as a bounty from His presence so that you may be among the grateful.

## Trim Your Nails

## Wash Your Feet

Every day in summer and at least once every three days in winter.

## Scent

We desire to see you as manifestations of paradise on earth, so that the fragrance emanating from you may gladden the hearts of those who are near.
