## Arise to Serve the Cause

We are commanded to serve the Cause of God in such a way where we are not influenced by the sorrows of disbelievers.

Carry out the ordinances out of love for God.

## Exalt Baha'u'llah's Word

Baha'u'llah will be with us in all conditions and will aid us with the truth.

## Be Steadfast

## Desires and Intentions

Break the boundaries of self

Break the boundaries of desire

Beware lest your desires prevent you from this bounty that has been decreed in the Book.

Do not let actions be the partner of hopes. The spirit of deeds is God's approval.

Read the Tablets to know what is intended in the Books of God.

## Do Not Rejoice in Your Possessions

In the morning they will belong to another.

There is no permanence in what is possessed.

There is no glory in self-exaltation

Do not collect luxurious ornaments.

Will spend what is possessed to have their names remembered before the Throne.

## Fidelity

There is permanence in fidelity, which is faithfulness to obligations, duties, and other observations.

## Reflect On Your Past Days

## Blessed Are Days In Remembrance of God

Hours devoted to His Praise.

## Provide for yourself

Do not waste your time in idleness and sloth.

The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idle and seek sustenance.

Do not seclude yourself

Do not seek ascetic hardships

Do not deny yourself what God allows
