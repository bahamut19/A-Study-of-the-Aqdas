## Arise to Serve the Cause

We are commanded to serve the Cause of God in such a way where we are not influenced by the sorrows of disbelievers.

Serve in all conditions. God will strengthen you with a power that encompasses the world.

Carry out the ordinances out of love for God.

We will aid anyone who rises to assist My Cause with the hosts of the celestial realm and a company of the nearest angels.

Proclaim the Cause of the Lord. It is the crown of deeds.

## Exalt Baha'u'llah's Word

Baha'u'llah will be with us in all conditions and will aid us with the truth.

## Desires and Intentions

Break the boundaries of self

Break the boundaries of desire

Beware lest your desires prevent you from this bounty that has been decreed in the Book.

Do not let actions be the partner of hopes. The spirit of deeds is God's approval.

Read the Tablets to know what is intended in the Books of God.

Music and melodies are permitted, as long as it does not take you away from a path of dignity and reverence. There is risk it can be made to be the wings of self and desire.

Beware lest the affairs of the self and desire cause division among you.

Your own selves can incite oppression and lewdness

## About a King Who Supports Baha'u'llah's Cause
