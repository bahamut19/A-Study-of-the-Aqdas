## Arise to Serve the Cause

We are commanded to serve the Cause of God in such a way where we are not influenced by the sorrows of disbelievers.

Serve in all conditions. God will strengthen you with a power that encompasses the world.

Carry out the ordinances out of love for God.

We will aid anyone who rises to assist My Cause with the hosts of the celestial realm and a company of the nearest angels.

Proclaim the Cause of the Lord. It is the crown of deeds.

## Turn to the Blessed Crimson Spot

Turn, O people, with radiant faces and hearts filled with light, to the blessed crimson spot where the Lote-Tree of the farthest limit proclaims: “There is no God but Me, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.”

## Raise up the Sacred Houses

Raise up the two houses in the two stations and the places wherein the Throne of your Lord, the Most Merciful, has been established

He said, if you attain what We reveal, you will ask from the grace of God for Him to reign upon your innermost selves, for that is a glory beyond reach.

## Exalt Baha'u'llah's Word

Baha'u'llah will be with us in all conditions and will aid us with the truth.

## Desires and Intentions

Break the boundaries of self

Break the boundaries of desire

Beware lest your desires prevent you from this bounty that has been decreed in the Book.

Do not let actions be the partner of hopes. The spirit of deeds is God's approval.

Read the Tablets to know what is intended in the Books of God.

Music and melodies are permitted, as long as it does not take you away from a path of dignity and reverence. There is risk it can be made to be the wings of self and desire.

Beware lest the affairs of the self and desire cause division among you.

Your own selves can incite oppression and lewdness

Do not be among those who wander in the wilderness of desires.

### Freedom

Desiring freedom and taking pride in it are in manifest ignorance.

Freedom ends in consequences that lead to discord, whose fire cannot be extinguished.

Know that the sources and manifestations of freedom are found in animals. For humanity, it is necessary to be under laws that protect them from the ignorance of their own selves and the harm of the deceitful. Freedom removes a person from the realm of courtesy and dignity, reducing them to the lowest of the low.

In some contexts a shepherd is needed, such as with freedom.

## Reflect On Your Past Days

## Blessed Are Days In Remembrance of God

Hours devoted to His Praise.

## Provide for yourself

## Hunting

It is permissible to use animals to hunt and catch prey. Using weapons is not mentioned. Before hunting, mention the name of God, and anything the animals catch is permissible. Do not act excessively.

## Path of Justice and Fairness in All Things

## Education

Read from sciences which benefit you, not those that lead to disputes in words.

We have ordained knowledge for the recognition of the known

Abandon people and what they possess

## Abandon Illusions

## About a King Who Supports Baha'u'llah's Cause

It is fitting for everyone to honor, revere, and assist him, that he may conquer cities with the keys of My Name, the One Who rules over all in the realms of the unseen and the seen.

Support him with wealth and lives.

## Do Not Object to Rule

No one should object to those who rule over the people. Leave them to what they have and turn towards the hearts.

## Turn Towards God

Do not follow every sinful claimant. Hold fast to the sure handle and the strong cord of My command.

## Fear God

Do not be of the veiled

## Be Prayerful in the Morning

Do not let the splendors of God's majesty prevent you from having a relationship with God each day. Take cup of prosperity in the morning and drink with the remembrance of His mighty and wondrous Name, Baha.

## A Pardon in Giving What You Possess

God has ordained for every soul to present before the Throne what they possess, of that which has no equal. We have, however, pardoned this as a favor from Us. Truly, He is the Most Generous, the Bestower.

## Rights of God (Ḥuqúqu’lláh)

If you possess 100 mithqáls (425g) of gold, nineteen mithqáls (80.75g) thereof belong to God.

Do not withhold yourselves from this great bounty.

Do not betray the Rights of God.

Do not deal with the Rights of God except with His permission.

Purpose is for the purification of wealth.

Purpose is drawing nearer to stations that none can attain except those whom God willed.

## Interpretation

One who interprets what has been revealed from the heaven of Revelation and deviates from its outward meaning is among those who have distorted the exalted Word of God and is accounted as one of the losers in the clear Book.

## Ask About the Cause of God

Ask what benefits you in the Cause of God and His dominion. Ask what your souls need, not what the men before you have spoken of. Be God-fearing.

## Illness

If you fall ill, refer to skilled physicians. We have not abolished the means, but rather established them

## Learning Languages

It is permitted to learn languages, in order to proclaim the Cause of God throughout the East and West. Through this, hearts may be drawn and every lifeless bone is revived.

## Consuming What Robs You of Reason

It is not befitting for a person of wisdom to consume which robs him of reason. Engage in what befits a human, not in actions committed by every heedless and suspicious soul.

This is not limited to recreational drugs and alcohol. Consider man-made chemicals, pharmaceuticals, environmental toxins, processed foods, and some forms of digital consumption. Dopamine.

## Journeys

There is no limitation in journeys.
