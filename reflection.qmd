Reflect, during the dawn and evening, on the mercy and favors of God. Give thanks.

reflects on these verses and discovers the hidden pearls within them, by God, will find the fragrance of the Merciful emanating from the direction of the prison, and his heart will hasten toward it with longingâ€”nothing will stop him, not the armies of the heavens or the earth

pearls of mysteries from the ocean

Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed in truth, and ponder it, and do not be of the transgressors.

Reflect on your end, don't be unjust

## Seeking Forgiveness

A believer is only allowed to seek forgiveness from God, not from any other person as a religious act. Repentance is only to be sought for by yourself and with God only. Also associated with this act of worship is the prohibition from kissing the hands of another person in an attempt to seek forgiveness.

No person can determine if you are saved, condemned, or any other form of divine judgment. God is Mighty and Forgiving. There are no exclusions based on any act, any perspective, or the like. The Aqdas does say the first command is about believing, which without belief makes you in error no matter what good deed you do. Without belief, you wouldn't even seek forgiveness from God. From who then, would grant you heaven?
