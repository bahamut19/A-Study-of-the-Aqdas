### Freedom

Desiring freedom and taking pride in it are in manifest ignorance.

Freedom ends in consequences that lead to discord, whose fire cannot be extinguished.

Know that the sources and manifestations of freedom are found in animals. For humanity, it is necessary to be under laws that protect them from the ignorance of their own selves and the harm of the deceitful. Freedom removes a person from the realm of courtesy and dignity, reducing them to the lowest of the low.

In some contexts a shepherd is needed, such as with freedom.

## A Pardon in Giving What You Possess

God has ordained for every soul to present before the Throne what they possess, of that which has no equal. We have, however, pardoned this as a favor from Us. Truly, He is the Most Generous, the Bestower.

## Interpretation

One who interprets what has been revealed from the heaven of Revelation and deviates from its outward meaning is among those who have distorted the exalted Word of God and is accounted as one of the losers in the clear Book.

## Ask About the Cause of God

Ask what benefits you in the Cause of God and His dominion. Ask what your souls need, not what the men before you have spoken of. Be God-fearing.

## Consuming What Robs You of Reason

It is not befitting for a person of wisdom to consume which robs him of reason. Engage in what befits a human, not in actions committed by every heedless and suspicious soul.

We have appointed a cause for everything from Our presence; hold fast to it and trust in the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.

## Built Up the Lands

# Housing

## Cleanliness

Wash whatever has been covered by dust and how much more so of encrusted dirt and filth beneath it.

## Refinement

If you are able to, renew the furnishings of your house every 19 years. He desires bringing ease and refinement to you and what you possess. If you are unable, they are pardoned by God.

# Actions Towards Others

## Be Like Fingers of One Hand, Limbs of One Body

Associate with each other in the spirit of joy and fragrance

Act with a spirit of friendliness

Act with a spirit of fellowship

## Kindness

And if anyone should anger you, meet them with kindness; and whoever rebukes you, do not rebuke them in return. Leave them to themselves and put your trust in God, the Avenger, the Just, the Almighty.

## Do Not Be Wicked with Power

## Differ On Any Matter

If you and another have a difference regarding any matter, Baha'u'llah instructs us to consult His Revelation, for it is sufficient to all peoples of the world. This passage also clearly demonstrates there is not need for outside interpretation, or other people's teachings to be used as an equivalent to Baha'u'llah's teachings.

We are to rely on Baha'u'llah's Revelation.

## Violent Acts

### Retaliation

Do not object to another, nor take one life for another.

### Manslaughter

Pay 100 mithqals of gold (425g or 15oz).

## Sexual Acts

### Adultery

Adultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.

There are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.

Adultery is punishable by the House of Justice. For the 1st offense, 9 mithqáls of gold is to be paid to the House of Justice. This is paid by the man and also paid by the woman. For the 2nd offense, the fine is doubled to 18 mithqáls. To understand the valuation, the box below can show the current value of gold. 9 mithqáls is approximately 38.25g, so you would take the value of gold per gram and multiply it by 38.25, according to the currency you use. The default is US Dollars.

<iframe src="https://www.kitco.com/gold-price-today-usa/" width="600" height="400">

</iframe>

The third offence is subjected to a humiliating punishment. The specifics of this has not been clarified, but could be done so by a House of Justice if needed. Baha'u'llah says any person afflicted by sin should repent, although this does not necessarily absolve the person from being punished by the House of Justice.

## Social Acts

### Backbiting

Backbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.

Additionally, Baha'u'llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say "I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?" The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.

The backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.

Now, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.

Finally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha'u'llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?

### Slander

Slander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another's reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.

### Do Not Cause Enmity

### Do Not Cause Discord

### Reconcile Differences

### Do Not Boast Over Another

## Property Acts

### Arson

The deliberate burning of a house is forbidden. The punishment is to burn the arsonist. The alternate punishment is life imprisonment.

### Stealing

Stealing is forbidden and is punishable by the Houses of Justice. Penalties include banishment, imprisonment, and for the third offense, a mark is to be placed on the forehead of the thief.

### Trespassing

Do not enter a house without permission

## Environmental Acts

### Do Not Corrupt the Earth

## Seeking Forgiveness From Others

Baha'u'llah forbids anyone to seek forgiveness from another as a religious duty. Only God can grant forgiveness if you repent from a sin.

This command also helps assure there is no hierarchy among the people of the community. This keeps one from exalting themselves over you, and also assures another does not place you in a position above them. We are all equals, born with a noble soul.

## Affairs of the Earth

Beware lest the affairs of the earth prevent you from what you are commanded. This is not a prohibition regarding the affairs of the earth.

Affairs could include material wealth and social status to personal desires, daily tasks, and ideological conflicts.

Be manifestations of justice and fairness between the heavens and the earth.

## Justice Towards Animals

Do not load an animal with more than it can bear. Forbidden in the most emphatic terms.

# Family Life

## Treating Kindred

Show love and kindness to your kindred.

None have a right to the wealth of the people. Mention inheritance.

## Marriage

Marriage is enjoined upon us. Enjoined is an authoritative instruction or directive which implies it is either required or highly encouraged. The same word is used regarding prayer and fasting, which is usually interpreted to mean as they are required, pending acceptable exceptions.

### Purpose of Marriage

The purpose of marriage is to have at least one child, a child who will remember God.

### Monogamy or Bigamy

The man is allowed up to two wives. More than two wives is not allowed. The man who is content with one wife with ensure both of their tranquility. This implies there can be complicating issues with polygamy. The first ones I can think of could be jealousy or a fear from the wife that perhaps she is not good enough to completely satisfy her husband. Insecurity definitely impacts tranquility. This means monogamy is preferred, although it is not required.

There is no rule which explicitly expresses a limitation on the number of husbands she can have. However, in regards to the teachings Baha'u'llah offers in his letters to Shiraz, he unequivacally states women are equal to men. Perhaps then, this is also applies to marriage law although there is no evidence a Baha'i woman ever married two men in the time of Baha'u'llah. This could merely be a function of Baha'is being subjected to Islamic law, which had a clear prohibition of female polygamy.

### Consent of Both Partners and Parents

Both the man and woman must consent to marriage. Neither can be forced to marry against their wishes. Also, marriage requires the person of all parents of both the bride and the groom. Baha'u'llah says it is to prevent discord or resentment among may arise the couple.

This also does not mean there must be arranged marriages.

He also says there are other purposes.

### Virginity

The husband is allowed to choose a virgin, but it is not a requirement. The implication of this verse is there is no punishment for the woman if she is not a virgin.

### Dowry

A marriage cannot be consummated without the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride. If the couple lives in the city, the dowry is based on 19 mithqáls (92.34) of gold. If they are in a village, 19 mithqáls of silver. The groom can give up to 95 mithqáls, but is not allowed to exceed it.

#### Gold

<iframe src="https://www.kitco.com/gold-price-today-usa/" width="600" height="400">

</iframe>

#### Silver

<iframe src="https://www.kitco.com/charts/livesilver.html" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

There isn't anything specified if one person lives in a city and the other in a village. My initial feeling is it is based on the groom's location or potentially where the married couple intends on living together once married.

Dowry is intended to be a gift which demonstrates the seriousness and sincerity of the man towards the woman. It can also help provide a safety net in case of some unexpected event or hardship for the woman.

### Travel and Abandonment

The following discusses the husband's role and will be framed in that context. However, this should also be able to apply if the spousal roles within the particular marriage are reversed, given the equality of men and women.

The husband is allowed to travel away from home. He must tell his wife how long he will be gone. If he returns and fulfills his promise, he is considered among the righteous.

If he is unable to return at the original specified time and has a genuine reason, he must inform his wife and make every effort to return at the newly specified time. He only has one chance. If he does not inform her of the delay, the wife is free to find another husband 9 months after the original return date. If he does not return by the second time, she is also free to find another husband 9 months after. The wife does not have to find a new husband. Baha'u'llah says God loves those who are patient, but this does not imply the woman would be loved less if she found a new husband.

During the 9 month waiting period, if news reaches her about her husband, she can choose to continue her marriage. She is not required to. God prefers reconciliation, but there should also be no actions which cause enmity.

If the husband passed away or was murdered, confirmed by a news report or 2 just witnesses, anytime during his travel, she also must wait. This could be 9 months, which can give time to grieve. After this, she may find a new husband if she chooses.

If the husband and wife travel together and discord arises between them, the husband must provide the wife with a full year's allowance and return her to where she departed, such as home. The other option is to entrust her to a trustworthy person and whatever is needed to take her to her destination. It would seem the full year's allowance is independent of the requirement to get his wife home. Also, it would also seem there would be room for both to consult on what would be best, such as how much is the allowance.

### Spirit of Joy and Fragrance

Associate with each other in a spirit of joy and fragrance. All that will endure are righteous deeds.

### Oppression and Lewdness

### Do Not Follow a Tyrannical and Wretched One

## Prohibited People

Fathers' Wives

Boys

## Divorce

God prefers unity and concord between a married couple, instead of separation and divorce. Still, divorce is allowed.

No one is allowed to divorce each other three times.

### The Waiting Period

Divorce is allowed if discord or aversion arises, but divorce cannot happen immediately. The couple must wait a year after the intention to divorce is expressed, with the hope the fragrance of love may emanate between them. At the end of the year, if no such fragrance emerged, then divorce is allowed. This also means if the married couple had sex in any form during the year, divorce is not allowed. The husband and wife must be consistent in their intentions.

An allowance will be given to the wife if there is no proven misconduct. The allowance is for the entire year.

If the two divorce, they do have the option to reconcile within one month if neither has married. Baha'u'llah emphasizes mutual love and consent. If the woman has a new husband, a new union is required to restore the relationship. This could mean the original husband would need to go through the original steps to marry, such as having the consent of both sets of parents, the payment of dowry, and a completely new marriage. On the woman's side, it only expresses love and consent, without an explicit requirement to be divorced or unmarried.

### Divorce for Misconduct

If the wife is divorced for proven misconduct, she will not have any allowance during the waiting period.

## Having a Child

As marriage is enjoined upon the believers, and the purpose of marriage is to have a child, having a child is also enjoined upon the believers.

## Stages of Maturity

Age 5 - Bab says a baby must not be struck. After age 5, five light blows are permitted.

Comprehension (Third Unity, Gate 5)

Manages Wealth & Property

Spiritual insight

## Children's Education

Fathers are enjoined to education their children. If they fail in this act, the House of Justice must act. This education must include writing and whatever has been prescribed in the Tablet. Educating a child is viewed as educating one of Baha'u'llah's own children. He provides His glory, loving-kindness, and mercy to fathers.

Education must also include learning. Learning could refer to specific subjects, or it could refer to the skills needed to enable a thorough education. Skills could include reading, mathematics, curiosity, critical thinking, problem solving, studying, adaptability, values, and principles.

Teach your children what has been sent down from the Heaven of Grandeur and Might, that they may recite the Tablets of the Merciful in the best melodies within the chambers built in the Mashriq-ul-Adhkárs. Whoever is enraptured by the love of My name, the Merciful, shall recite the verses of God in such a manner that the hearts of those who slumber will be moved. Blessed is he who drinks the nectar of life from the utterance of his Lord, the Merciful, by this name, through which every lofty and towering mountain has been shattered.

# Inheritence

## Funeral

Burial of the dead in crystal, stone resistant to decay, or fine, hard woods.

Shroud the deceased in 5 garments of silk or cotton. If unable to do 5 garments, 1 will suffice.

The placing of engraved rings on their fingers. The rings should say "I began from God and returned to Him, detached from all else, and clinging to His name, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate."

Do not transport the body more than 1 hour. Bury him with spirit and fragrance in a nearby place.

## Write a Will

It has been ordained for every soul to write a will. Let them adorn its heading with the Greatest Name, declare therein the oneness of God in the Manifestation of His appearance, and include within it whatever good deeds they wish to be remembered for, that it may bear witness to them in the worlds of command and creation and serve as a treasure for them in the presence of their Lord, the Faithful Guardian.

## Obligations Prior to Inheritance

Inheritance cannot be distributed until certain obligations have been addressed. These obligations include the funeral expenses, debts, and the Right of God payment.

## Inheritance Distribution

Split from the Letter Z (Number 7)

I.  Descendants - Book Ṭ (9) according to number of M, Q, T – ~~540~~ + 540 = 1080 (42.8%)
II. Spouses - Book Ḥ (8) according to number T and F – ~~480~~ - 90 = 390 (15.5%)
III. Fathers - Book Z (7) according to number T and K – ~~420~~ - 90 = 330 (13.1%)
IV. Mothers - Book W (6) according to number R, F, Y, A – ~~360~~ - 90 = 270 (10.7%)
V.  Brothers - Book H (5) according to number Sh – ~~300~~ - 90 = 210 (8.3%)
VI. Sisters - Book D (4) according to number R and M – ~~240~~ - 90 = 150 (6.0%)
VII. Teachers - Book J (3) according to number Q and F – ~~180~~ - 90 = 90 (3.6%)

## How Shares are Calculated

The Books add up to 42. This is the portion each category will receive. For example, the descendants will receive 9 of 42 parts (21.4%). Originally, the part with the according to whichever letters adds up to 2520 shares. 540 of 2520 shares is also 21.4%. If you divide the 2520 shares by the 42 books, each book is worth 60 shares.

Baha'u'llah changed the Babi distribution to double the portion to descendants. This ended up being another 540 shares, with 90 shares being removed from the other 6 categories.

## Inhabited House

If the house is inhabited by descendants, the male descendants inherit the house. If the house is uninhabited, the house could be sold and the proceeds distributed accordingly.

## Specified Garments

Specific garments are to be given to the male descendants. This may not exactly mean common clothing defined by gender roles. Instead, this could mean garments which have a significant meaning or purpose within the family. Ceremonial, spiritual, and culturally significant garments would be included. This also implies these types of garments are not to be sold as part of the estate, and remain a part of the family.

## Heirs Younger Than the Age of Maturity

Their portion is to be managed as a trust by a trustee. The trustee could be a lawyer, institutional investor, a family member, or anyone else specified to act as a trustee. This should be managed as a legal trust. The trustee is not entitled to any of the money within the trust, but is entitled to an agreed upon portion of any profit created from investments. The inheritance will be distributed once the heir reaches the age of maturity.

## Exceptions

If there are no descendants, their portion will go to the House of Justice. (1080 of 2520 shares)

If the deceased has descendants but no other specified heirs, 2/3rds will go to the descendants and 1/3rd will go to the House of Justice. For example, if there is no spouse, 260 of 2520 shares will be added to the descendants for a total of 1340 shares. 130 shares will go to the House of Justice.

If there are no direct heirs from the first 6 categories but there are nephews, nieces, or their children, 2/3rds will go to them and 1/3rd to the House of Justice.

If there are no direct heirs and no nephews, nieces, or their children, the inheritance from the first 6 categories will go to the House of Justice.

## The Spiritual Aspect of Inheritance

Throughout the verses regarding inheritance, Baha'u'llah reminds us that God is bountiful and merciful. No matter the amount of inheritance provided, any person who receives some should be grateful for the bounty provided. There are no exceptions based upon judgments of character or other qualifications to receive. This ensures there is no vying for an increased portion, or any attempts to deny another their portion. This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.

There is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha'u'llah's command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved's life is beneficial for the community.

Beware lest names keep you from their Master.

Beware remembrance veils you

Beware lest the mention of the Prophet keeps you from this Greatest Announcement, or allegiance to one veils you from the authority of God, the Sovereign over all that is in the heavens and the earth. Every name has been created by His Word, and every matter is bound to His irrevocable command, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

We see among you those who take the Book and use it to prove God, just as every community has used its own book to prove the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God, the True One! The books of the world and all the scriptures therein avail you nothing today, except by this Book, which speaks at the pivot of creation

Beware lest you become the cause of discord in the regions, as you were the reason for rejection in the beginning. Gather the people around this Word, by which the pebble cried out: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the Dawning-Place of Signs." Thus does God admonish you, as a favor from Him.

Act with Justice

The one who turns away from this Cause—can he prove any truth in creation?

Fear God and do not deny

Tear asunder the veils, so that the inhabitants of the Kingdom may hear the sound of their rending. This is the command of God, from before and after. Blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded, and woe unto those who turn away.

We have desired in the dominion only the appearance of God and His sovereignty, and sufficient is God as My witness. We have desired in the kingdom only the exaltation of the Cause of God and His praise, and sufficient is God as My trustee. We have desired in the realm of power only the remembrance of God and what has been revealed from Him, and sufficient is God as My helper.

### **Key Differences Between the Realms**

| **Aspect** | **Dominion (Al-Mulk)** | **Kingdom (Al-Malakūt)** | **Realm of Power (Al-Jabarūt)** |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Focus** | Physical/material reality | Spiritual reality | Divine transcendence and power |
| **Laws** | Temporal and human-made laws | Spiritual and eternal principles | God’s sovereign, creative will |
| **Accessibility** | Through physical actions and governance | Through faith and insight | Known only through divine revelation |
| **Purpose in Verse** | Manifestation of God’s sovereignty | Exaltation of God’s Cause | Remembrance of God’s majesty |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **How They Relate to Bahá'u'lláh’s Mission**

Bahá'u'lláh connects all three realms to His purpose: - In the **dominion**, He reveals laws and guidance to transform society. - In the **kingdom**, He exalts the spiritual truths and principles needed for individual and collective enlightenment. - In the **realm of power**, He affirms the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God, the source of all existence.

### People of Insight

## Scholars in the Cause of Baha

You are the waves of the Most Great Ocean

You are the Stars of the heavens of bounty

You are the Banners of victory between the heavens and the earth

You are the Dawning Places of Steadfastness among the people

You are the Rising-points of utterance for those in existence.

Blessed is the one who turns towards you

Woe to the heedless

## Shaykh Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi

Mention the Shaykh who was called Muhammad before Hasan, who was among the most learned of scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and others like him turned away, while one who winnowed wheat and barley turned toward God. He spent his nights and days writing, as he claimed, the judgments of God, but when the Chosen One appeared, not a single letter of his work availed him. Had it benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face through which the countenances of the near ones are illumined. If you had believed in God at His appearance, the people would not have turned away from Him, and what has befallen Us today would not have occurred. Fear God and do not be among the heedless.

He was a the author of "Jawāhir al-kalām fī sharḥ sharāʾiʿ al-islām," a book about Shi'a jurisprudence.

## Karim

Recall Karim, when We summoned him to God, and he grew arrogant, following his own desires, even after We sent to him that which delighted the eye of proof in the realms of existence and completed the argument of God upon all in the heavens and the earth. We commanded him to turn in acceptance, as a favor from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Yet he turned away, retreating, until the hosts of torment seized him, as a just decree from God. Verily, We were witnesses.

## Cannot Match Baha'u'llah

None can match Baha'u'llah in the field of mystical insight, knowledge, wisdom, and expression.

## Baha'u'llah Weeps

The eye of My favor weeps for you, for you have not recognized the One whom you call upon in the evening and at dawn, at every sunset and daybreak
