## Children's Education

Fathers are enjoined to education their children. If they fail in this act, the House of Justice must act. This education must include writing and whatever has been prescribed in the Tablet. Educating a child is viewed as educating one of Baha'u'llah's own children. He provides His glory, loving-kindness, and mercy to fathers.

Education must also include learning. Learning could refer to specific subjects, or it could refer to the skills needed to enable a thorough education. Skills could include reading, mathematics, curiosity, critical thinking, problem solving, studying, adaptability, values, and principles.

Teach your children what has been sent down from the Heaven of Grandeur and Might, that they may recite the Tablets of the Merciful in the best melodies within the chambers built in the Mashriq-ul-Adhkárs. Whoever is enraptured by the love of My name, the Merciful, shall recite the verses of God in such a manner that the hearts of those who slumber will be moved. Blessed is he who drinks the nectar of life from the utterance of his Lord, the Merciful, by this name, through which every lofty and towering mountain has been shattered.

# Inheritence

## Funeral

Burial of the dead in crystal, stone resistant to decay, or fine, hard woods.

Shroud the deceased in 5 garments of silk or cotton. If unable to do 5 garments, 1 will suffice.

The placing of engraved rings on their fingers. The rings should say "I began from God and returned to Him, detached from all else, and clinging to His name, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate."

Do not transport the body more than 1 hour. Bury him with spirit and fragrance in a nearby place.

## Write a Will

It has been ordained for every soul to write a will. Let them adorn its heading with the Greatest Name, declare therein the oneness of God in the Manifestation of His appearance, and include within it whatever good deeds they wish to be remembered for, that it may bear witness to them in the worlds of command and creation and serve as a treasure for them in the presence of their Lord, the Faithful Guardian.

## Obligations Prior to Inheritance

Inheritance cannot be distributed until certain obligations have been addressed. These obligations include the funeral expenses, debts, and the Right of God payment.

## Inheritance Distribution

Split from the Letter Z (Number 7)

I.  Descendants - Book Ṭ (9) according to number of M, Q, T – ~~540~~ + 540 = 1080 (42.8%)
II. Spouses - Book Ḥ (8) according to number T and F – ~~480~~ - 90 = 390 (15.5%)
III. Fathers - Book Z (7) according to number T and K – ~~420~~ - 90 = 330 (13.1%)
IV. Mothers - Book W (6) according to number R, F, Y, A – ~~360~~ - 90 = 270 (10.7%)
V.  Brothers - Book H (5) according to number Sh – ~~300~~ - 90 = 210 (8.3%)
VI. Sisters - Book D (4) according to number R and M – ~~240~~ - 90 = 150 (6.0%)
VII. Teachers - Book J (3) according to number Q and F – ~~180~~ - 90 = 90 (3.6%)

## How Shares are Calculated

The Books add up to 42. This is the portion each category will receive. For example, the descendants will receive 9 of 42 parts (21.4%). Originally, the part with the according to whichever letters adds up to 2520 shares. 540 of 2520 shares is also 21.4%. If you divide the 2520 shares by the 42 books, each book is worth 60 shares.

Baha'u'llah changed the Babi distribution to double the portion to descendants. This ended up being another 540 shares, with 90 shares being removed from the other 6 categories.

## Inhabited House

If the house is inhabited by descendants, the male descendants inherit the house. If the house is uninhabited, the house could be sold and the proceeds distributed accordingly.

## Specified Garments

Specific garments are to be given to the male descendants. This may not exactly mean common clothing defined by gender roles. Instead, this could mean garments which have a significant meaning or purpose within the family. Ceremonial, spiritual, and culturally significant garments would be included. This also implies these types of garments are not to be sold as part of the estate, and remain a part of the family.

## Heirs Younger Than the Age of Maturity

Their portion is to be managed as a trust by a trustee. The trustee could be a lawyer, institutional investor, a family member, or anyone else specified to act as a trustee. This should be managed as a legal trust. The trustee is not entitled to any of the money within the trust, but is entitled to an agreed upon portion of any profit created from investments. The inheritance will be distributed once the heir reaches the age of maturity.

## Exceptions

If there are no descendants, their portion will go to the House of Justice. (1080 of 2520 shares)

If the deceased has descendants but no other specified heirs, 2/3rds will go to the descendants and 1/3rd will go to the House of Justice. For example, if there is no spouse, 260 of 2520 shares will be added to the descendants for a total of 1340 shares. 130 shares will go to the House of Justice.

If there are no direct heirs from the first 6 categories but there are nephews, nieces, or their children, 2/3rds will go to them and 1/3rd to the House of Justice.

If there are no direct heirs and no nephews, nieces, or their children, the inheritance from the first 6 categories will go to the House of Justice.

## The Spiritual Aspect of Inheritance

Throughout the verses regarding inheritance, Baha'u'llah reminds us that God is bountiful and merciful. No matter the amount of inheritance provided, any person who receives some should be grateful for the bounty provided. There are no exceptions based upon judgments of character or other qualifications to receive. This ensures there is no vying for an increased portion, or any attempts to deny another their portion. This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.

There is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha'u'llah's command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved's life is beneficial for the community.

Creates veils to hinder the people.

Glory of the Exalted Will Not Endure

The Ornaments of the Wealthy Will Not Endure

The Power of the Wicked Will Not Endure

One who interprets what has been revealed from the heaven of Revelation and deviates from its outward meaning is among those who have distorted the exalted Word of God and is accounted as one of the losers in the clear Book.

Speaks contrary to what has been revealed in the Tablets

## Believes in Former Revelation

Intoxicated in the

## How to Act Towards Them

We should act in a way where their own sorrows do not overcome us.

Do not stumble by recognizing that He is not to be questioned about what He does.

## Humiliating Punishment

For those whose eyes have been intoxicated in the former and the latter.

# Leaders of Religion

## Concourse of Ulama (Religious Scholars)

Do not worship the idols of your own desires. Do not view yourself as greater than God. Even Nimrod is in the lowest depths of Hell. Abandon your illusions and turn towards God.

Prided yourselves on My Name yet been heedless of My Self.

Do not weigh the Book of God with the rules and sciences you possess, nor with your desires.

If you turn towards God and enter into the cause, do not corrupt it.

Beware lest you create another veil to hinder the people.

Beware lest names keep you from their Master.

Beware remembrance veils you

Beware lest the mention of the Prophet keeps you from this Greatest Announcement, or allegiance to one veils you from the authority of God, the Sovereign over all that is in the heavens and the earth. Every name has been created by His Word, and every matter is bound to His irrevocable command, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

We see among you those who take the Book and use it to prove God, just as every community has used its own book to prove the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God, the True One! The books of the world and all the scriptures therein avail you nothing today, except by this Book, which speaks at the pivot of creation

Beware lest you become the cause of discord in the regions, as you were the reason for rejection in the beginning. Gather the people around this Word, by which the pebble cried out: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the Dawning-Place of Signs." Thus does God admonish you, as a favor from Him.

Act with Justice

The one who turns away from this Cause—can he prove any truth in creation?

Fear God and do not deny

Tear asunder the veils, so that the inhabitants of the Kingdom may hear the sound of their rending. This is the command of God, from before and after. Blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded, and woe unto those who turn away.

We have desired in the dominion only the appearance of God and His sovereignty, and sufficient is God as My witness. We have desired in the kingdom only the exaltation of the Cause of God and His praise, and sufficient is God as My trustee. We have desired in the realm of power only the remembrance of God and what has been revealed from Him, and sufficient is God as My helper.

### **Key Differences Between the Realms**

| **Aspect** | **Dominion (Al-Mulk)** | **Kingdom (Al-Malakūt)** | **Realm of Power (Al-Jabarūt)** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Physical/material reality | Spiritual reality | Divine transcendence and power |
| **Laws** | Temporal and human-made laws | Spiritual and eternal principles | God’s sovereign, creative will |
| **Accessibility** | Through physical actions and governance | Through faith and insight | Known only through divine revelation |
| **Purpose in Verse** | Manifestation of God’s sovereignty | Exaltation of God’s Cause | Remembrance of God’s majesty |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **How They Relate to Bahá'u'lláh’s Mission**

Bahá'u'lláh connects all three realms to His purpose: - In the **dominion**, He reveals laws and guidance to transform society. - In the **kingdom**, He exalts the spiritual truths and principles needed for individual and collective enlightenment. - In the **realm of power**, He affirms the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God, the source of all existence.

### People of Insight

## Scholars in the Cause of Baha

You are the waves of the Most Great Ocean

You are the Stars of the heavens of bounty

You are the Banners of victory between the heavens and the earth

You are the Dawning Places of Steadfastness among the people

You are the Rising-points of utterance for those in existence.

Blessed is the one who turns towards you

Woe to the heedless

## Shaykh Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi

Mention the Shaykh who was called Muhammad before Hasan, who was among the most learned of scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and others like him turned away, while one who winnowed wheat and barley turned toward God. He spent his nights and days writing, as he claimed, the judgments of God, but when the Chosen One appeared, not a single letter of his work availed him. Had it benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face through which the countenances of the near ones are illumined. If you had believed in God at His appearance, the people would not have turned away from Him, and what has befallen Us today would not have occurred. Fear God and do not be among the heedless.

He was a the author of "Jawāhir al-kalām fī sharḥ sharāʾiʿ al-islām," a book about Shi'a jurisprudence.

## Karim

Recall Karim, when We summoned him to God, and he grew arrogant, following his own desires, even after We sent to him that which delighted the eye of proof in the realms of existence and completed the argument of God upon all in the heavens and the earth. We commanded him to turn in acceptance, as a favor from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Yet he turned away, retreating, until the hosts of torment seized him, as a just decree from God. Verily, We were witnesses.

## Cannot Match Baha'u'llah

None can match Baha'u'llah in the field of mystical insight, knowledge, wisdom, and expression.

## Baha'u'llah Weeps

The eye of My favor weeps for you, for you have not recognized the One whom you call upon in the evening and at dawn, at every sunset and daybreak
