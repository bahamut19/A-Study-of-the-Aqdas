There is no limitation in journeys.

Do not stumble by recognizing that He is not to be questioned about what He does.

## Humiliating Punishment

For those whose eyes have been intoxicated in the former and the latter.

# Leaders of Religion

## Concourse of Ulama (Religious Scholars)

Do not worship the idols of your own desires. Do not view yourself as greater than God. Even Nimrod is in the lowest depths of Hell. Abandon your illusions and turn towards God.

Prided yourselves on My Name yet been heedless of My Self.

Do not weigh the Book of God with the rules and sciences you possess, nor with your desires.

If you turn towards God and enter into the cause, do not corrupt it.

Beware lest you create another veil to hinder the people.

Beware lest names keep you from their Master.

Beware remembrance veils you

Beware lest the mention of the Prophet keeps you from this Greatest Announcement, or allegiance to one veils you from the authority of God, the Sovereign over all that is in the heavens and the earth. Every name has been created by His Word, and every matter is bound to His irrevocable command, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

We see among you those who take the Book and use it to prove God, just as every community has used its own book to prove the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God, the True One! The books of the world and all the scriptures therein avail you nothing today, except by this Book, which speaks at the pivot of creation

Beware lest you become the cause of discord in the regions, as you were the reason for rejection in the beginning. Gather the people around this Word, by which the pebble cried out: "The Kingdom belongs to God, the Dawning-Place of Signs." Thus does God admonish you, as a favor from Him.

Act with Justice

The one who turns away from this Cause—can he prove any truth in creation?

Fear God and do not deny

Tear asunder the veils, so that the inhabitants of the Kingdom may hear the sound of their rending. This is the command of God, from before and after. Blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded, and woe unto those who turn away.

### **How They Relate to Bahá'u'lláh’s Mission**

Bahá'u'lláh connects all three realms to His purpose: - In the **dominion**, He reveals laws and guidance to transform society. - In the **kingdom**, He exalts the spiritual truths and principles needed for individual and collective enlightenment. - In the **realm of power**, He affirms the ultimate authority and sovereignty of God, the source of all existence.

### People of Insight

## Scholars in the Cause of Baha

You are the waves of the Most Great Ocean

You are the Stars of the heavens of bounty

You are the Banners of victory between the heavens and the earth

You are the Dawning Places of Steadfastness among the people

You are the Rising-points of utterance for those in existence.

Blessed is the one who turns towards you

Woe to the heedless

## Shaykh Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi

Mention the Shaykh who was called Muhammad before Hasan, who was among the most learned of scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and others like him turned away, while one who winnowed wheat and barley turned toward God. He spent his nights and days writing, as he claimed, the judgments of God, but when the Chosen One appeared, not a single letter of his work availed him. Had it benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face through which the countenances of the near ones are illumined. If you had believed in God at His appearance, the people would not have turned away from Him, and what has befallen Us today would not have occurred. Fear God and do not be among the heedless.

He was a the author of "Jawāhir al-kalām fī sharḥ sharāʾiʿ al-islām," a book about Shi'a jurisprudence.

## Karim

Recall Karim, when We summoned him to God, and he grew arrogant, following his own desires, even after We sent to him that which delighted the eye of proof in the realms of existence and completed the argument of God upon all in the heavens and the earth. We commanded him to turn in acceptance, as a favor from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Yet he turned away, retreating, until the hosts of torment seized him, as a just decree from God. Verily, We were witnesses.

## Cannot Match Baha'u'llah

None can match Baha'u'llah in the field of mystical insight, knowledge, wisdom, and expression.

## Baha'u'llah Weeps

The eye of My favor weeps for you, for you have not recognized the One whom you call upon in the evening and at dawn, at every sunset and daybreak
