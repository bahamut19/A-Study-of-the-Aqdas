## Notes from LLM

Consultation, or taking counsel, is a fundamental divine ordinance revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of creation, established as a necessary foundation for both individual and collective action. This divine command has been established in the Books of both past and present, and is a matter that must be firmly adhered to in every case.

### The Essence and Exaltation of Consultation

Consultation is defined not merely as discussion, but as an essential spiritual pillar:

1.  

2.  **Luminaries of Wisdom:** The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with two luminaries: consultation and compassion.

3.  

4.  **Guide and Bestower:** Consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding. It increases awareness and transforms conjecture into certitude. It is a shining light in the dark worldâ€”it guideth and directeth.

5.  

6.  **Source of Confirmation:** Consultation has been and will be a guide and is confirmed by the Holy Spirit. Those who gather for consultation for the sake of God and speak about what benefits His servants have their hearts inspired. Reliance upon consultation assures that the consultants "shall assuredly be inspired with that which is the cause and source of success and prosperity".

7.  

8.  **Means to Well-being:** There is no good or well-being except through consultation. Consultation has been and will continue to be the cause and means of awareness, vigilance, welfare and safety. Man's ascent to the heaven of well-being and safety is dependent upon the ladder of consultation.

9.  

10. **Prerequisite for Unity:** Unity and goodly deeds are the basis for power. Consultation assists in achieving unity, for in gathering together are signs for those who seek the face of their Lord.

11. 

So essential is the principle that it is stated: "We have commanded consultation, therefore We Ourselves consult".

### Guiding Principles and Conditions

The sources emphasize that consultation must be adorned with specific spiritual qualities and principles, particularly wisdom:

1.  

2.  **Wisdom is Imperative:** The triumph of the Cause has been made to depend upon utterance, and utterance itself "must needs be proportioned to the capacity of each soul". Consultation must be held fast unto, and its command is most firm. Deviation from wisdom is not permitted. Whosoever departs from wisdom shall yield no fruit, even if the action be "pure good," but rather "evil will result from it".

3.  

4.  **Refinement and Moderation:** Utterance within consultation requires both penetrating power and moderation. Penetration depends upon refinement, which is conditioned upon detached and pure hearts. Moderation is obtained by blending utterance with the tokens of divine wisdom found in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets.

5.  

6.  **Purpose of Service:** The focus of consultation must be solely for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof, having regard for the interests of the servants of God.

7.  

8.  **Avoiding Discord:** All must hold fast to unity and shun discord, for discord has been and will be the cause of the dissipation of God's Cause. Souls are counselled to utilize consultation to unite hearts and souls and to exalt the Word.

9.  

### Application in Divine Affairs

Consultation is binding in various spheres of activity, especially those related to the promotion and organization of the Cause.

#### 1. Teaching the Cause

The teaching of the Cause is commanded upon all, but teaching must be conducted with wisdom and utterance. It is explicitly revealed that in every city, several souls should gather specifically to consult about teaching God's Cause, determining what manner is most advisable.

#### 2. Administrative and Governing Bodies

The establishment of a consultative assembly or House of Justice in every city is ordained. Those gathered for counsel are called "counsellors to the number of Baha," and they should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God. These elected representatives or members of assemblies should take counsel together, concerning themselves only with what profits mankind. The purpose of such consultation is that "the affairs of Thy servants \[may\] prosper, and Thy cities \[may\] flourish".

The Trustees of the House of Justice are charged to take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them, trusting that God will inspire them with whatsoever He willeth. The manifestation of service and exaltation depends upon the consultation of the trustees of the House of Justice.

#### 3. Matters of Movement, Property, and Personal Life

Movement, travel, and orientation towards regions for teaching are contingent upon consultation, and obedience to the outcome is required. Decisions regarding matters such as acquiring property for trade or dealing with general financial affairs are dependent upon consultation. The arrangement of marriage, including conditional matters like the consent of both parties and parents, must also hold fast to consultation.

### Procedure for Consultation

Specific procedures have been revealed for managing consultation, especially when disagreement arises:

1.  

2.  **Assembly and Quorum:** A consultative assembly is blessed. Gatherings for counsel should generally be limited, and it is preferable not to exceed the number of the Greatest Name (nine), or even to suffice with the number of "Ha" (five).

3.  

4.  **Dealing with Disagreement:** If consultation among the initial group ends in disagreement, new people should be added. Thereafter, souls numbering the Greatest Name, or fewer or more, should be chosen by lot. The consultation must then be renewed, and whatever emerges is to be obeyed. If disagreement still persists after this procedure is repeated, the decision of the majority shall prevail. Alternatively, if disagreement arises between two, they may "adorn the two with a third and take the strongest".

5.  

Consultation ensures that the foundation of the Cause is firm and that hearts are united and affairs progress. It is the path by which the light of unity may illumine all hearts and minds.
