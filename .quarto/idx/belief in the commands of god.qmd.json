This is the mention of God, before and after, with which He has embroidered the fabric of the Book of Existence, if you are of those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-1]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #138\n\nBaha'u'llah affirms this is the religion of God from before and after.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-2] The Book of Existence encompasses all of creation, not just the Command. However, the Command is derived from the Book of Existence and is the standard for creation. The Command from before does not have everything within the Book of Existence, neither does the current, and neither does the future Command. Baha'u'llah says \"Regarding the question about the heavenly names, the pulse of the world is in the hands of the knowledgeable physician. He sees the ailment and with His wisdom, He treats it. Each day has its own secret, and every matter has its own sound. The remedy for today’s pain is one thing, and for tomorrow, another. Be mindful of today and speak of today’s matters.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-3]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #182\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-3]: Tablet of Mánikchí Ṣáḥib\n\nBasically there are many chapters in the Book of Existence, an eternal reality which precedes and outlasts creation itself. God does not promise any chapter will be the only chapter forever, but through the covenant expressed within each chapter, there is also the promise of future chapters which are more adapted to the needs and aspirations of humankind. Not everything in a chapter is completely new, but each prior chapter establishes the foundations for the next. Any archaeologist will testify history is built in layers. Religion is a part of this history.\n\n### Revelation\n\nEach chapter of the Book of Existence is unveiled through divine revelation, adapting to the spiritual needs of each age. Revelation is the disclosure of truth or knowledge from God. It is the process by which God's command is unveiled, renewing itself in every age. Given one of God's attributes is Subtly, it could be difficult for a person to believe in revelation when it happens. There are many traditions out there which teach their revelation is the final revelation for the rest of time. There are other traditions where it is taught because the recent revelation is true, prior revelations could not have been true.\n\nThis is the Revelation around which evidence and proof circle.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-4] God does what He wills and decrees what He desires. This is a test of faith for many. \"They do not consider the manifestations of divine Oneness impossible in the realm of dominion, and if a soul deems it impossible, what difference is there between him and those who considered God’s hand to be tied? And if they regard God, exalted be His mention, as free to choose, they must accept every command that emanates from the source of His decree, without escape or refuge. There is no sanctuary or shelter except in Him. The matter that requires presenting evidence and proof of a claim is not contingent upon the opinions of people, whether knowledgeable or ignorant, and it never has been and never will be.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-5] Revelation itself is the proof of divine authority, not whether people accept it.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-4]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #136\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-5]: Surah of the Temple Verses 241 & 242\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas describes this revelation as the most exalted and most wondrous. \"In every subsequent manifestation, the appearance of God is the most exalted.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-6] This does not take away from the station of prior revelations, and future revelations will also be most exalted and wondrous when compared to this current one.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-6]: The Persian Bayan, Vahid 4, Gate 12\n\n### The Book\n\nThroughout the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah refers to the Book. Baha'u'llah uses the word Book to describe various aspects of creation and the knowledge God has. Often times in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Book without any other description refers to the Kitab-i-Aqdas itself. \"This blessed verse was mentioned: His Exalted Majesty said, “Refer what you do not understand from the Book to the branch that has branched from this mighty root.” The ‘Book’ refers to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and the ‘branch that has branched off from this mighty root’ refers to the Aghsan.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-7]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-7]: A Tablet to Varqa (Letters to Yazd) and BH00057\n\nBelief in the Command of God means believing in the Kitab-i-Aqdas as the Book, the Most Exalted and Wondrous Revelation, and an update in the single religion of God. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is central to the continuity of God's favor upon us, the latest expression of Divine Will. It is a Mercy for us and a proof of divine authority. It is the source of true freedom. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is all of this and a source of the divine ordinances and laws. The rest of the chapter will expand upon these themes further.\n\n## **The Continuity of Divine Command Across Dispensations**\n\nWhen the King of Austria (a Christian) visited the al-Aqsa Mosque (Muslim) in Jerusalem (Jewish Holy Place), Baha'u'llah tells him he passed by the Light of Divine Unity coming from the prison of Akka.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-8] There was an opportunity to experience the Oneness of God. There was an opportunity to experience the continuity of divine command across revelatory dispensations. The King had an opportunity to believe in unity. Believing in the command of today would mean believing in the command of yesterday. It encompasses all prior commands.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-8]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #85\n\nThe prior commands and prior books span across history, but not all words claiming to be God's book is God's book. For example, Baha'u'llah says the Qur’án, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Torah, and the Bayan[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-9] are revelations from God. If we look at the Bible, the Gospel would include the words and actions of Jesus Christ as documented in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, John, and Luke. This does not include the sermons of Paul who wrote or inspired the writings of Acts, Romans, and other New Testament books. There is a distinction in the command coming through a Manifestation of God versus the inspirations of the leader immediately following the Manifestation. Paul was not the Word but was subservient to the Word. Elsewhere, Baha'u'llah testifies to the truths of Zoroastrian and Hindu teachings as being relevant to the relative position of people in time and condition.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-10] This command could be inclusive of all cultures which discuss a deity, worship, and social guidance. Belief in the command does not necessarily mean spending a great effort determining what exactly from the past was from God and what was from the inspirations of normal people like you and I. Belief in the command means to acknowledge God is the source of all truth before, during, and after today. Baha'u'llah warns in the Kitab-i-Aqdas \"The books of the world and all the scriptures therein avail you nothing today, except by this Book, which speaks at the pivot of creation.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-11] Through the name of God All-Encompassing, the Command of Today encompasses and surpasses all the Commands of Yesterday. This is a vital belief on the path of Divine Unity.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-9]: The Kitab-i-Badi\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-10]: Tablet to Manichki Sahib\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-11]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #168\n\n### The Most Great Command\n\nBaha'u'llah describes the Command of today as the Most Great Order, the Most Great Law, the Most Great Proof, and the Most Great Balance. He says \"The order has been disturbed by this Most Great Order, and the arrangement has been altered by this wondrous Revelation, the like of which the eye of creation has never witnessed.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-12] This is a testament in the fact there are good things from the past worth keeping, which can provide a positive contribution to the future. It is also a testament to the fact for the need of the old to be rearranged and altered in a new and substantial way. Progress cannot happen if we hold onto the old ways of doing things. Progress requires a belief that God's religion is progressively unfolding and adapting to the needs of different ages.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-12]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #181\n\nThe Most Great Proof testifies to the truthfulness of this claim. \"This is the Balance of Guidance for those in the heavens and on the earth, and the Most Great Proof, if only you knew. Say: Through it, every proof has been established throughout the ages, if only you were certain. Say: Through it, every poor soul has been enriched, every learned one has been taught, and whoever desires to ascend unto God has been lifted up. Beware lest you differ concerning it.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-13] The proof can be witnessed through the development of the ages, such as through the Islamic Golden Age or the rise of powerful Hindu kingdoms throughout Southeast Asia. New revelation brings new prosperity for those who believe and implement the Most Great Command. Just as the Islamic Golden Age ended and the Hindu Kingdoms of the Khmer gave way to Buddhist cultures, we must also allow God to continue guiding us to better ways of living and being.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-13]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #183\n\nThis is because of the Command being the Most Great Balance and Most Great Law. The balance cannot be measured by prior rules and sciences which existed yesterday.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-14] The Balance fulfills the prophecies of old,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-15] the Covenant of God, and is the balance of justice. When the balance of justice is set up on the Day of Resurrection, everyone will be given their due.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-16] Who has status and honor yesterday may not have status and honor today. A law which was raised to the heights of heaven yesterday may be annulled today. The Command is both immutable and variable depending on what we need. The Most Great Law is for all in heaven and on earth,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-17] not just for a select few. It is the standard of judgment for all today, not only for tomorrow.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-14]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #99\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-15]: Lawh-i-Ishraqat (Tablet of Splendors)\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-16]: Surah to the Kings\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-17]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #6\n\n\"Everything is realized by His decisive command when the Sun of ordinances rises from the horizon of explanation. All are to follow it, even if it be a command that rends asunder the hearts of the adherents of religions. He does as He wills and is not questioned about what He wills.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-18]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-18]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #7\n\n## The Command is Manifestations of Light\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas utilizes many forms of symbolism to describe the Command and Revelation of God. Many of these names and symbols focuses on how the Command manifests the Light, such as is associated with the Day of Resurrection. The Command is the Sun of Wisdom and the Sun of Explanation. Within the laws and counsel, there are pathways to understanding, the application of knowledge, and explanations and interpretations.\n\nThe Sun emerges from the Sundrat-ul Muntaha at dawn. The Command is the dawning place of the knowledge of God and is adorned with the Seal of the Breaker of the Dawn, who speaks between the heavens and the Earth.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-19] This affirms the Command is authentically divine and a true pathway away from darkness. Just as God had bestowed upon Muhammad the title Seal of the Prophets, the seal authenticates what came prior, it also unseals divine mysteries. As a seal could also denote finality, we know the Sun and the command are unalterable. They are forever true, even when the Sun arises again in the future. As the Sun rises for the new Day, the Command can also be known as the Book of Origin.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-20] While final and unalterable, it is also new and as fresh as the first days of springtime.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-19]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #117\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-20]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #121\n\nEven outside of the revelation being the dawn of a new day, the command also serves as a lamp, lighting a pathway for us on our spiritual destination. The Kitab-i-Aqdas describes the command as a Lamp of God's Care, a Lamp of Wisdom, a Lamp of Success, and a Lamp of Eternity. These lamps serve to guide us, providing direction, nurture, and a promise of success for our souls. Much like how God led the Jews from Egypt to the promised land of Canaan, the Kitab-i-Aqdas will lead people to their spiritual destiny.\n\n\"This is a Book that has become the Lamp of Eternity for the world and its most upright Path among the peoples. Say: It is the Dawning-Place of the knowledge of God, if you but knew, and the Rising-Point of the commandments of God, if you but recognized.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-21]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-21]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #186\n\n## The Command Nurtures Us\n\n\"O Greatest Sea! Sprinkle upon the nations that which you have been commanded by the Ancient Lord, and adorn the temples of humankind with the fabric of the laws through which hearts may rejoice and eyes be brightened.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-22]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-22]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #96\n\nWhen you look at a fabric, you can see the finest fabrics have a high density of interwoven threads which provide strength, durability, and protection. The fine fabric provides comfort and beauty, being able to help a person uniquely express their own personality and character. The fabric of laws serves a similar purpose. They are to adorn the temple of humankind, the same temple used to elevate the souls to the heights of heaven. One must beware not to remove threads from the fabric. The fabric could seem weak and dull. It will not cause hearts to rejoice nor brighten the eyes of those who witness it. All of the laws are like an ornament[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-23] helping others to recognize the beauty of the Command.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-23]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #98\n\n\"From My laws, the fragrance of My garment are diffused.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-24] Baha'u'llah expresses fragrance regularly in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and elsewhere. Fragrance is a pleasant smell emanating from an object, in this case God's garment. The laws are a source of this diffusion. As a pleasant smell attracts a lover to their beloved, or a bee to a flower, the laws can also attract the hearts of a spiritual seeker. \"Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner. By My life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of grace will circle around My commands which have shone forth from the horizon of creativity.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-25] The nectar is also described as the nectar of life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-26] Anyone who wears this fabric of laws will be examples of a loving and nurturing justice and life.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-24]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-25]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-26]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #150\n\nBaha'u'llah tells us not to consider the Command and the Kitab-i-Aqdas as merely as laws, but as the choice sealed wine.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-27] Drinking from this wine, much like how the disciples of Jesus did in the last supper, will cause every bone to be set in motion with life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-28] Imagine the fragrance of such a wine. Who wouldn't want to inhale it and drink it? Who wouldn't want others to inhale it and drink it?\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-27]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #5\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-28]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #173\n\nThe Command is also often referred to in terms of water. Water has always been considered a purifying element. The Bab says \"it symbolizes the radiance of the Sun of His bounty.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-29] Those who act in accordance to the Command are drinking from the Kawthar (abundant river from paradise) of life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-30] These pure and flowing waters from the clear stream provide prosperity when drunk with the belief and remembrance of God.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-31] The water may be provided as showers of grace[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-32] poured down from heaven as a favor from God to us. These waters act as a salvation and a great gift to us.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-29]: The Persian Bayan Vahid 5, Gate 14\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-30]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #73\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-31]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #50\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-32]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #55\n\nWe are also nurtured by the Command coming forth the Most Great Ocean. Within the ocean are pearls of knowledge and wisdom.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-33] The ocean serves as a great metaphor for the bounties of God. Depending on the depths one is able to dive to, there is incredible amounts of knowledge, wisdom, and mysteries waiting to be attained. These pearls are valuable, but as they can only be had through diving, require effort and work to reach. These are not just free gifts.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-33]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #180\n\n\"Beware that compassion does not prevent you from carrying out the laws of God. Act according to what you have been commanded by a compassionate and merciful Lord. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and laws for your own protection and the elevation of your station, just as parents nurture their children.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-34] As this nurture is from God in the role of Divine Parent out of love for us, we must also \"carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.'[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-35]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-34]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #45\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-35]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\nBelief in the commands of God is belief in the love of God. Belief in the commands of God also requires a love for God and the beauty of God's creation.\n\n## The Command Provides True Freedom\n\nThe laws of the Command serve mostly as bounds.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-36] These boundaries serve as a framework whereupon the soul may be elevated and the world within which we live can better manifest the spiritual qualities of heaven. This does not mean we should expect some type of fraudulant utopia. All of this requires work and requires skill navigating these boundaries. These boundaries are not particularly strict and are the cause of absolute freedom.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-37]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-36]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #148\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-37]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #125\n\nIn this small sermon about freedom from the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah says:\n\n> 123 Freedom ends in consequences that lead to discord, whose fire cannot be extinguished—thus informs you the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know that the sources and manifestations of freedom are found in animals. For humanity, it is necessary to be under laws that protect them from the ignorance of their own selves and the harm of the deceitful. Freedom removes a person from the realm of courtesy and dignity, reducing them to the lowest of the low.\n>\n> 124 Observe the people; they are like sheep, in need of a shepherd to protect them—this is indeed an absolute truth. We affirm this in certain contexts but not in others, for We are all-knowing.\n>\n> 125 Say: True freedom lies in following My commandments, if you are of those who know. If people were to follow what We have revealed to them from the heaven of divine revelation, they would find themselves in absolute freedom. Blessed is the one who understands the purpose of God in what has been revealed from the heaven of His will, which reigns supreme over all the worlds. Say: The freedom that benefits you is found in servitude to the True God, and whoever has tasted its sweetness will not trade it for the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.\n\nTrue freedom is derived from the protection the Command provides. The command is keys to God's mercy,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-38] helping us unlock new doors of realization and possibility derived from God's love. These possibilities from true freedom is not solely for the individual. \"The ordinances of God as the greatest means for the order of the world and the preservation of nations.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-39] The scope of the Command is great. The Command is not merely for individual belief, but is also designed for the order of the world.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-38]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #3\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-39]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #3\n\n\"'There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.' This is a station God has designated for this most wondrous, most exalted Revelation. This is from the grace of God, if you are of those who know. This is from His irrevocable command, His greatest name, His supreme word, and the dawning place of His most excellent names, if you are of those who understand. Indeed, by it, all the rising and setting points are made manifest. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed in truth, and ponder it, and do not be of the transgressors.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-40]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-40]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #143\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Command of God has been made new. It is more than being a book of laws. Belief in the full station of this Command also reflects the belief in God, belief in the soul, and belief in the worlds of God. Believing the Command is a reflection of God's Will, Love, Mercy, and all the other names gives purpose to action. Thus, to believe in the Command is to believe in the unfolding of God’s will, to see divine order in all things, and to recognize that the next step in understanding this reality is belief in the Manifestation of God Himself.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## **Introduction: The Divine Command as the Source of Order**\n\nBelief in the Command of God is central to the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the entire revelation of Baha'u'llah.

Elsewhere, Baha'u'llah testifies to the truths of Zoroastrian and Hindu teachings as being relevant to the relative position of people in time and condition.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-10] This command could be inclusive of all cultures which discuss a deity, worship, and social guidance. Belief in the command does not necessarily mean spending a great effort determining what exactly from the past was from God and what was from the inspirations of normal people like you and I. Belief in the command means to acknowledge God is the source of all truth before, during, and after today. Baha'u'llah warns in the Kitab-i-Aqdas \"The books of the world and all the scriptures therein avail you nothing today, except by this Book, which speaks at the pivot of creation.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-11] Through the name of God All-Encompassing, the Command of Today encompasses and surpasses all the Commands of Yesterday. This is a vital belief on the path of Divine Unity.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-9]: The Kitab-i-Badi\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-10]: Tablet to Manichki Sahib\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-11]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #168\n\n### The Most Great Command\n\nBaha'u'llah describes the Command of today as the Most Great Order, the Most Great Law, the Most Great Proof, and the Most Great Balance. He says \"The order has been disturbed by this Most Great Order, and the arrangement has been altered by this wondrous Revelation, the like of which the eye of creation has never witnessed.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-12] This is a testament in the fact there are good things from the past worth keeping, which can provide a positive contribution to the future. It is also a testament to the fact for the need of the old to be rearranged and altered in a new and substantial way. Progress cannot happen if we hold onto the old ways of doing things. Progress requires a belief that God's religion is progressively unfolding and adapting to the needs of different ages.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-12]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #181\n\nThe Most Great Proof testifies to the truthfulness of this claim. \"This is the Balance of Guidance for those in the heavens and on the earth, and the Most Great Proof, if only you knew. Say: Through it, every proof has been established throughout the ages, if only you were certain. Say: Through it, every poor soul has been enriched, every learned one has been taught, and whoever desires to ascend unto God has been lifted up. Beware lest you differ concerning it.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-13] The proof can be witnessed through the development of the ages, such as through the Islamic Golden Age or the rise of powerful Hindu kingdoms throughout Southeast Asia. New revelation brings new prosperity for those who believe and implement the Most Great Command. Just as the Islamic Golden Age ended and the Hindu Kingdoms of the Khmer gave way to Buddhist cultures, we must also allow God to continue guiding us to better ways of living and being.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-13]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #183\n\nThis is because of the Command being the Most Great Balance and Most Great Law. The balance cannot be measured by prior rules and sciences which existed yesterday.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-14] The Balance fulfills the prophecies of old,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-15] the Covenant of God, and is the balance of justice. When the balance of justice is set up on the Day of Resurrection, everyone will be given their due.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-16] Who has status and honor yesterday may not have status and honor today. A law which was raised to the heights of heaven yesterday may be annulled today. The Command is both immutable and variable depending on what we need. The Most Great Law is for all in heaven and on earth,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-17] not just for a select few. It is the standard of judgment for all today, not only for tomorrow.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-14]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #99\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-15]: Lawh-i-Ishraqat (Tablet of Splendors)\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-16]: Surah to the Kings\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-17]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #6\n\n\"Everything is realized by His decisive command when the Sun of ordinances rises from the horizon of explanation. All are to follow it, even if it be a command that rends asunder the hearts of the adherents of religions. He does as He wills and is not questioned about what He wills.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-18]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-18]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #7\n\n## The Command is Manifestations of Light\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas utilizes many forms of symbolism to describe the Command and Revelation of God. Many of these names and symbols focuses on how the Command manifests the Light, such as is associated with the Day of Resurrection. The Command is the Sun of Wisdom and the Sun of Explanation. Within the laws and counsel, there are pathways to understanding, the application of knowledge, and explanations and interpretations.\n\nThe Sun emerges from the Sundrat-ul Muntaha at dawn. The Command is the dawning place of the knowledge of God and is adorned with the Seal of the Breaker of the Dawn, who speaks between the heavens and the Earth.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-19] This affirms the Command is authentically divine and a true pathway away from darkness. Just as God had bestowed upon Muhammad the title Seal of the Prophets, the seal authenticates what came prior, it also unseals divine mysteries. As a seal could also denote finality, we know the Sun and the command are unalterable. They are forever true, even when the Sun arises again in the future. As the Sun rises for the new Day, the Command can also be known as the Book of Origin.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-20] While final and unalterable, it is also new and as fresh as the first days of springtime.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-19]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #117\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-20]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #121\n\nEven outside of the revelation being the dawn of a new day, the command also serves as a lamp, lighting a pathway for us on our spiritual destination. The Kitab-i-Aqdas describes the command as a Lamp of God's Care, a Lamp of Wisdom, a Lamp of Success, and a Lamp of Eternity. These lamps serve to guide us, providing direction, nurture, and a promise of success for our souls. Much like how God led the Jews from Egypt to the promised land of Canaan, the Kitab-i-Aqdas will lead people to their spiritual destiny.\n\n\"This is a Book that has become the Lamp of Eternity for the world and its most upright Path among the peoples. Say: It is the Dawning-Place of the knowledge of God, if you but knew, and the Rising-Point of the commandments of God, if you but recognized.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-21]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-21]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #186\n\n## The Command Nurtures Us\n\n\"O Greatest Sea! Sprinkle upon the nations that which you have been commanded by the Ancient Lord, and adorn the temples of humankind with the fabric of the laws through which hearts may rejoice and eyes be brightened.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-22]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-22]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #96\n\nWhen you look at a fabric, you can see the finest fabrics have a high density of interwoven threads which provide strength, durability, and protection. The fine fabric provides comfort and beauty, being able to help a person uniquely express their own personality and character. The fabric of laws serves a similar purpose. They are to adorn the temple of humankind, the same temple used to elevate the souls to the heights of heaven. One must beware not to remove threads from the fabric. The fabric could seem weak and dull. It will not cause hearts to rejoice nor brighten the eyes of those who witness it. All of the laws are like an ornament[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-23] helping others to recognize the beauty of the Command.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-23]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #98\n\n\"From My laws, the fragrance of My garment are diffused.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-24] Baha'u'llah expresses fragrance regularly in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and elsewhere. Fragrance is a pleasant smell emanating from an object, in this case God's garment. The laws are a source of this diffusion. As a pleasant smell attracts a lover to their beloved, or a bee to a flower, the laws can also attract the hearts of a spiritual seeker. \"Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner. By My life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of grace will circle around My commands which have shone forth from the horizon of creativity.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-25] The nectar is also described as the nectar of life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-26] Anyone who wears this fabric of laws will be examples of a loving and nurturing justice and life.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-24]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-25]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-26]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #150\n\nBaha'u'llah tells us not to consider the Command and the Kitab-i-Aqdas as merely as laws, but as the choice sealed wine.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-27] Drinking from this wine, much like how the disciples of Jesus did in the last supper, will cause every bone to be set in motion with life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-28] Imagine the fragrance of such a wine. Who wouldn't want to inhale it and drink it? Who wouldn't want others to inhale it and drink it?\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-27]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #5\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-28]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #173\n\nThe Command is also often referred to in terms of water. Water has always been considered a purifying element. The Bab says \"it symbolizes the radiance of the Sun of His bounty.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-29] Those who act in accordance to the Command are drinking from the Kawthar (abundant river from paradise) of life.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-30] These pure and flowing waters from the clear stream provide prosperity when drunk with the belief and remembrance of God.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-31] The water may be provided as showers of grace[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-32] poured down from heaven as a favor from God to us. These waters act as a salvation and a great gift to us.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-29]: The Persian Bayan Vahid 5, Gate 14\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-30]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #73\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-31]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #50\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-32]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #55\n\nWe are also nurtured by the Command coming forth the Most Great Ocean. Within the ocean are pearls of knowledge and wisdom.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-33] The ocean serves as a great metaphor for the bounties of God. Depending on the depths one is able to dive to, there is incredible amounts of knowledge, wisdom, and mysteries waiting to be attained. These pearls are valuable, but as they can only be had through diving, require effort and work to reach. These are not just free gifts.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-33]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #180\n\n\"Beware that compassion does not prevent you from carrying out the laws of God. Act according to what you have been commanded by a compassionate and merciful Lord. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and laws for your own protection and the elevation of your station, just as parents nurture their children.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-34] As this nurture is from God in the role of Divine Parent out of love for us, we must also \"carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.'[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-35]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-34]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #45\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-35]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4\n\nBelief in the commands of God is belief in the love of God. Belief in the commands of God also requires a love for God and the beauty of God's creation.\n\n## The Command Provides True Freedom\n\nThe laws of the Command serve mostly as bounds.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-36] These boundaries serve as a framework whereupon the soul may be elevated and the world within which we live can better manifest the spiritual qualities of heaven. This does not mean we should expect some type of fraudulant utopia. All of this requires work and requires skill navigating these boundaries. These boundaries are not particularly strict and are the cause of absolute freedom.[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-37]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-36]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #148\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-37]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #125\n\nIn this small sermon about freedom from the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah says:\n\n> 123 Freedom ends in consequences that lead to discord, whose fire cannot be extinguished—thus informs you the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know that the sources and manifestations of freedom are found in animals. For humanity, it is necessary to be under laws that protect them from the ignorance of their own selves and the harm of the deceitful. Freedom removes a person from the realm of courtesy and dignity, reducing them to the lowest of the low.\n>\n> 124 Observe the people; they are like sheep, in need of a shepherd to protect them—this is indeed an absolute truth. We affirm this in certain contexts but not in others, for We are all-knowing.\n>\n> 125 Say: True freedom lies in following My commandments, if you are of those who know. If people were to follow what We have revealed to them from the heaven of divine revelation, they would find themselves in absolute freedom. Blessed is the one who understands the purpose of God in what has been revealed from the heaven of His will, which reigns supreme over all the worlds. Say: The freedom that benefits you is found in servitude to the True God, and whoever has tasted its sweetness will not trade it for the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.\n\nTrue freedom is derived from the protection the Command provides. The command is keys to God's mercy,[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-38] helping us unlock new doors of realization and possibility derived from God's love. These possibilities from true freedom is not solely for the individual. \"The ordinances of God as the greatest means for the order of the world and the preservation of nations.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-39] The scope of the Command is great. The Command is not merely for individual belief, but is also designed for the order of the world.\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-38]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #3\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-39]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #3\n\n\"'There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.' This is a station God has designated for this most wondrous, most exalted Revelation. This is from the grace of God, if you are of those who know. This is from His irrevocable command, His greatest name, His supreme word, and the dawning place of His most excellent names, if you are of those who understand. Indeed, by it, all the rising and setting points are made manifest. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed in truth, and ponder it, and do not be of the transgressors.\"[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-40]\n\n[^belief-in-the-commands-of-god-40]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #143\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Command of God has been made new. It is more than being a book of laws. Belief in the full station of this Command also reflects the belief in God, belief in the soul, and belief in the worlds of God. Believing the Command is a reflection of God's Will, Love, Mercy, and all the other names gives purpose to action. Thus, to believe in the Command is to believe in the unfolding of God’s will, to see divine order in all things, and to recognize that the next step in understanding this reality is belief in the Manifestation of God Himself.\n\n{{< pagebreak
