{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-introduction","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nPraise be to God, the Creator of and Source of all inspiration, knowledge, and wisdom!\n\nAllah'u'abha!\n\nThe Bab and Baha'u'llah, from 1844 to 1892, ushered in a new era for all mankind. The culmination of their revelations, the Bayan by the Bab in 1848, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha'u'llah in 1873, offer the framework to develop individuals, communities, and nations in a newly spiritual way. The Bayan, which was unfinished prior to the Bab's execution in 1850, was symbolically completed by the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Up until this point in 2025, there have been no English language studies of the entire Kitab-i-Aqdas. This is partially because many followers of Baha'u'llah merely view the book as only a book of laws, partially because it was not translated until over a 100 years after its completion, and partially because other authors are more preeminent among communities which believe in Baha'u'llah.\n\nThis book aims to place the Kitab-i-Aqdas in the exalted position it deserves to be. To do this, we need to understand the Kitab-i-Aqdas is more than a book of laws, it is the framework for God's will, which is to guide people towards salvation, to create distinct spiritual communities, and to bring about unity among the people of the world. The Bayan will be used as a primary supplement, as well as other writings by Baha'u'llah. No other sources will be considered. It is a technique which is rarely used, to use Scripture to explain Scripture.\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas makes no claim of starting completely from scratch, to not have any prior origins or inspirations. It also does not deny the reality of the ways of the world in which it was created. The world was already deep into the Industrial Revolution and on the cusp of the Modern age. Some societies were progressing in certain qualities more than others, which brought with each certain strengths and certain weaknesses. What the Kitab-i-Aqdas does is act like a composer of music, taking instruments which already exist, notes and chords which already exist, and using them to create an entirely new composition. This composition is entirely unique in itself, but shouldn't be terribly strange to anyone. When listened to in its entirety, you will feel its vibrations within your soul, a soul which does yearn to have a relationship with the divine. This composition is itself a new technique able to create more heavenly compositions, where the compositions are the various organizations of society. This has its place to refine what already exists so that mankind can be prepared, guided, and inspired to continue its progress into perpetual tomorrow, a tomorrow of hope, love, and if so desired, peace.\n\nI make no claim of expertise, divinity, or scholarly prowess. I do not claim where the contents of this book is the only way to interpret the Kitab-i-Aqdas. My perspective is but one perspective and my hope is more authors offer their own perspectives on this magnificent work. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is worthy of scholarship and a place on every bookshelf, coffeetable, and handbag.\n\nThis book will be divided into six parts. The first part will be the pillars of belief and will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. The second part will focus on the relationship we are capable of having with God. After this, we will cover the life of the individual, which will build off the first two parts. The life of the individual will focus a more legalistic approach that will guide a person's everyday actions and attitude. The fourth part will expand the life of the individual to community and family life. The fifth part will focus the prior two parts towards those who lead, who bear more responsibility than those who do not. The final part will discuss the Houses of Justice, whose purpose requires all the lessons learned from the prior five parts.\n\nI am grateful you have given this book a chance to be read. Thank you!\n\n{{< pagebreak
