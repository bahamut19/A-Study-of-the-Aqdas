{"title":"Introduction","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-introduction","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nPraise be to God, the Creator of and Source of all inspiration, knowledge, and wisdom!\n\nAllah’u’abha!\n\nThe Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, from 1844 to 1892, ushered in a new era for all mankind. The culmination of their revelations, the Bayán by the Báb in 1848 and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas by Bahá’u’lláh in 1873, offer a framework to develop individuals, communities, and nations in a newly spiritual way. The Bayán, which was unfinished prior to the Báb’s execution in 1850, was symbolically completed by the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. This book began with a desire to study the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and to understand what it is truly offering humanity, not only in isolated passages, but as a complete and integrated work.\n\nWhen I first began writing, I had a narrower vision of what the book would become. I expected to remain close to the surface of the text, speaking about themes and laws in a straightforward way. As the chapters unfolded, the Aqdas drew me further inward and further outward at the same time. It drew me inward into belief, prayer, and the reality of the soul. It drew me outward into relationships, community life, leadership, and peace. Writing this book became a process of discovery, where the Kitáb-i-Aqdas increasingly revealed itself as a composition of spiritual life, rather than a list of isolated commands.\n\nThis book aims to place the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in the exalted position it deserves to be. To do this, we need to understand the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is more than a book of laws. It is a framework for God’s will, which is to liberate souls, to create distinct spiritual communities, and to bring about unity among the people of the world. It does not speak only to what we should do, but to who we are, what we can become, and what kind of world can emerge when human beings learn to live in justice and mercy. It is not meant to crush the soul beneath obligation, but to awaken the soul into dignity, purpose, and spiritual maturity.\n\nThe Bayán will be used as a primary supplement, as well as other writings by Bahá’u’lláh. No other sources will be considered. This is not because other voices have no value, but because I wanted the Scriptures to speak with their own force and internal coherence. It is a technique which is rarely used, to use Scripture to explain Scripture. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas makes no claim of starting completely from scratch, to not have any prior origins or inspirations. It also does not deny the reality of the world in which it was created. The world was already deep into the Industrial Revolution and on the cusp of the Modern age. Societies were progressing in certain qualities more than others, and each society carried strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhat the Kitáb-i-Aqdas does is act like a composer of music, taking instruments, notes and chords which already exist, and using them to create an entirely new composition. This composition is unique in itself, but it should not be terribly strange to anyone. When listened to in its entirety, you may feel its vibrations within your soul, a soul which does yearn to have a relationship with the divine. This composition is itself a technique able to create more heavenly compositions, where the compositions are the various organizations of society. It refines what already exists so that mankind can be prepared, guided, and inspired to continue its progress into perpetual tomorrow, a tomorrow of hope, love, and if so desired, peace.\n\nI make no claim of expertise, divinity, or scholarly prowess. I make no claim where the contents of this book is the only way to interpret the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. My perspective is but one perspective and my hope is more authors offer their own perspectives on this magnificent work. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is worthy of scholarship and a place on every bookshelf, coffeetable, and handbag.\n\nThis book is divided into four parts. The first part is the pillars of belief and serves as the foundation for the rest of the book. The second part focuses on the relationship we are capable of having with God along with the virtues this relationship develops. The third part starts to explore the practical application of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas on our private lives and relationships, outlining a set of rights and responsibilities from birth to maturity. The fourth part explores leadership in the civil and faith-based spheres, culminating in a vision of the future we can all be a part of.\n\nDifferent readers will approach this book with different needs. Some may be seeking clarity of belief. Some may be seeking a devotional path that is practical and sustaining. Some may be recovering from deep emotional wounds and need a gentle way to return to God without fear. Some may be looking for a way to teach others without coercion, and to support growth without control. Some may be drawn to the chapters on leadership and peace, because they sense that the future of mankind depends on spiritual principles being applied with wisdom. The book is written to hold all of these paths together, because the Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself holds them together. Inner life and outer life cannot be separated for long without injury to one or the other.\n\nWhether you currently believe in Bahá’u’lláh or not, I feel the Kitáb-i-Aqdas has something to offer for everyone. Liberation is for everyone, to include you and your loved ones. I am grateful you have given this book a chance to be read. Thank you!\n\n{{< pagebreak
