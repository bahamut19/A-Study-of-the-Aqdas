{"title":"Belief in God","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Belief in God"},"headingText":"19 Groups of Names and Attributes","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas never explicitly says it is required to believe in God, but the mention of God is everywhere within it. The belief in God is foundational to everything else within the Kitab-i-Aqdas. The book is rarely considered a mystical treatise nor is rarely recommended to read to learn how to grow your spirit. In reality, the Kitab-i-Aqdas's entire purpose is the growth of the human spirit through a constant interweaving of mystic teachings, theology, and straightforward commands.\n\nOne way Baha'u'llah enables this journey is by ensuring God is part of every single command and teaching. He does this by calling on God's various names and attributes. I counted 110 different names used for God within the Kitab-i-Aqdas. This is not every name of God and of course all of names can exist within every language. Both the Bab and Baha'u'llah would teach God is inclusive of all names and is the source of all names. Instead of studying all 100 different names, the next section will focus on a grouping these names and attributes into 19 groups. I chose 19 due to the significance of the number in representing unity. These 19 groups will attempt to start with one concept and use this concept to progress to the next concept. Each group name will also have a number showing how often the names in the group appear in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\n\n\n### **Subtlety (2)**\n\nSubtlety is the quality of being difficult to analyze or even detect. When combined with the name Inaccessible, we can start to imagine God's mysterious and hidden nature. God may seem unable to be directly observed, or to some, lacking in direct evidence or proof. Yet, these qualities are highly nuanced. Subtlety can be viewed as an interweaving of words, meanings, ideas, and feelings which language may not be able to fully convey, or the conveyance can be completely relative to the contexts of time, space, and perspective. In one moment you may have an understanding and in the next, you gain a different understanding.\n\nThere are hundreds of traditions which attempt to explain who God is through art, music, dance, and poetic stories. They are filled with metaphor, exaggerated expressions, and other methods in an attempt to express the mystery which is God. Each are expressions of the subtlety of God, when all taken together are a divine tapestry whose threads are interwoven in truth and a shared experience along a spiritual journey. This also means there is more than one way to experience God. The Kitab-i-Aqdas provides the framework to open up these experiences, to find the different pathways to explore the hidden nature of God. All one must do is seek, to be a seeker.\n\nThe next 18 groups include the quality of Subtlety.\n\n### **Manifestation (2)**\n\nOne way God assists the seeker is by manifesting signs that hint at His presence. The purpose is to make the inaccessible more accessible, even if it isn't accessibility in God's entirety. These signs might not be obvious like a stop sign, but could be more like being nearsighted as you approach a highway sign pointing to multiple paths. It may be something not immediately clear, or if you are looking in a different direction, the sign is something you may not observe. Signs are full of subtlety.\n\nThese signs could come from the natural world and the laws of creation in which we are a part of. They could come from others like ourselves through their actions, thoughts, and feelings. They could even come from our own imagination or subconscious, such as with a dream. A seeker may not observe every sign and when a sign is observed, may not understand the significance of the sign completely. A person who is not seeking may not even be aware there are signs. Yet, they are there for everyone with great consistency.\n\nGod can be made Manifest in different forms to include through humanity. A human Manifestation of God is a reflection and embodiment of God Himself. This will go into deeper detail regarding Manifestations of God in the chapter \"Belief in the Manifestation of God.\"\n\nThe next 17 groups include the quality of Manifestation.\n\n### **Knowledge (46)**\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas uses the names such as All-Knowing, All-Informed, Wise, and the Knower of All Things frequently. These words conveys God's own infinite knowledge, a knowledge when Manifested is all full of Subtlety. Sometimes the knowledge may seem inaccessible or difficult to understand. This is an acceptable perspective. Sometimes knowledge is entirely based on perspective, especially within space and time. What a person knows in one moment as true can change as facts change, conditions change, or new knowledge becomes known. What is true within the Kitab-i-Aqdas is God possesses all knowledge.\n\nSometimes this knowledge is viewed as a knowledge of all facts. This could be knowledge of what is within our hearts. It could be knowledge of all possible outcomes. This could be a knowledge of all which has been manifested. This could be a knowledge of all which could be manifested. This knowledge is derived from the Manifestations of the Signs.\n\nAs names such as All-Knowing exist with Subtlety, these infinite modes of potential clarity and understanding are interwoven within each other, completely nuanced, and are all pathways to the name Manifest. This knowledge leads to God being the Wise, knowing how to apply knowledge in the best way possible.\n\nThe next 16 groups include the quality of Knowledge.\n\n### **Creation (6)**\n\nGod's names include the Dawning Place of Signs and the Creator of the Earth and Heavens. Creation is manifested through God's Knowledge. God's role as Creator begins to become evident, showing how His knowledge shapes and sustains the universe.\n\nWith God being the creator, is also demonstrates God's eternal preexistence. God is the Creator, not the created. God is the Cause and Creation is the Effect. Through Knowledge, God is able to express His purpose, and through Creation He is able to fulfill this purpose. As God is the Creator of the Earth and Heavens, He is the Creator of all we are able to observe and all which we are unable to observe. God is the Creator of the Seen and the Unseen. God is the creator of all we feel and experience. God is the creator of all purpose, of all action, of all energy, and of all matter. God is the creator of you and I, and all which we care about.\n\nCreation demonstrates Subtlety in that even seemingly simple things, such as a human cell, are complex and quite mysterious. The How and the Why a cell originates and functions demonstrate the subtle craftmanship of a Creator, whereupon so far the answers to why remain quite inaccessible. All of Creation maintains this Subtlety.\n\nThe next 15 groups include the quality of creation.\n\n### **Power (36)** \n\nThe Power group includes the second most frequency of names in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. These names include the Almighty, All-Powerful, All-Capable, All-Subduing, and All-Sufficient. Each of these names express a different mode or aspect of God as Power. With God being the Creator, an awareness of God's Power and omnipotence follows.\n\nMight can be synonymous with strength, especially with the traditional notions of being able to exert a great amount of force. Power can be viewed in how strength can be projected, or the ability to exert influence. Being capable is the ability to get things done, especially through skill. Subduing is being able to express one's Will over another. Being All-Sufficient means being qualified and competent in using power to achieve the required goals and to fulfill purpose.\n\nThese names all demonstrate God's ability to govern and sustain all which has been created. Notice how Power comes after other attributes such as being All-Knowing. Knowledge leads to Power. Power itself does not lead to being All-Knowing. This shows, in a way, how being Almighty or All-Subduing can be quite nuanced by Subtlety. Skill in using might and power involves knowing what tools to use, or exactly the right amount of energy to achieve the purpose within creation. The use of power might be a challenge to understand, as is understanding God's Will, which is a Will that subdues all of creation. The Will of God could be quite difficult to comprehend or fathom, also being a part of the greater mystery of God. There is hidden strength, such as how fine-tuned the laws of physics are or how life seemingly came from inert matter. Power does not need to be coercive but instead influential, such as in the role to guide hearts or establish those natural laws. The rotation of the planets or the growth of a seed show how God can invisibly utilize power. There doesn't need to be extravagant, one-time shows of might for power to be manifested. Because God manifests the Signs, power does not need to be a show of domination, but a gentle way to empower creation to flourish. Dramatic interventions are always possible with God if it serves a purpose, and whether they are dramatic or subtle, the power is always transformative.\n\nThe next 14 groups include the quality of power.\n\n### **Lordship (51)** \n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas includes many different ways in describing the various ways God is Lord. The title of Lord is used to describe concepts such as the Lord of Beauty, of all Religion, of Grandeur, of the Seen and Unseen. Lordship can be defined as God's ultimate authority. This authority would be over all creation and is derived from God's knowledge and power. Lordship can discuss authority and governance. This authority is absolute, encompassing everything which is seen and unseen. Lordship is universal, transcending all divisions, stations, ranks, and beliefs.\n\nGod is the ruler over all creation, although as God is Subtlety, Lordship can also be a mystery. Lordship might be observed through the Manifestation of Signs, understood through Knowledge, witnessed through Creation, and felt through Power.\n\nThe next 13 groups include the quality of lordship.\n\n### **Justice (6)** \n\nJustice is expressed through the names Judge, Just, and Reckoner. Justice can often be seen as the determination between right and wrong. It can also be viewed as the balance expressed through God's Lordship. Although justice can often be immediately evident, Subtlety allows for justice to be precise, operating beyond the surface. This includes realities which can seem hidden, such as intentions, unseen consequences, or other spiritual conditions.\n\nJustice can be witnessed through the various signs manifested, especially in how perfectly ordered creation is. Justice requires the omniscience of God to truly be balanced, informed of every action, intention, and consequence. Justice is the fulfillment of the purpose of creation in an equitable way. Justice requires God's power to be upheld. Power without justice can become tyranny. Justice ensures power is fair and equitable. All of creation benefits from justice.\n\nGod as an All-Capable Reckoner is able to calculate and account for all actions, intentions, and consequences, to include those seemingly unknown. God as the All-Knowing Judge determines the best rulings according to divine principles. Judgment and reckoning are required for justice to be implemented. As Lord, God's justice becomes evident as does order within His governance.\n\nThe next 12 groups include the quality of justice.\n\n### **Exaltation (9)**\n\nGod's justice demonstrates God's exalted nature. The names of Most Exalted, Most High, Great, Majestic, Most Glorious, and the Greatest Infallibility come from God's role as Just. Without justice, God's Power, Lordship, and Knowledge would be unworthy of exaltation. However, because of God's Justice, nothing else in creation can be more exalted than God.\n\nGiven God's Knowledge and Power, the Name of Greatest Infallibility demonstrates the fairness and righteousness of justice, showing that God does not and will not error. God's Subtlety can make His Exaltation seem veiled, especially when compared to more superficial things we can place above ourselves, or when we place ourselves above everything. Subtlety is what creates awe and acknowledges the extraordinary nature, despite being incomprehensible. The Manifestation of the Signs and of God help reveal different aspects of God's exalted nature.\n\nThe belief in God's Exaltation is not because God feels jealousy if you do not, nor needs to be exalted to feel good. The belief in God's Exaltation is a function of God's Lordship and Justice above any other form of justice and authority.\n\nThe next 11 groups include the quality of exaltation.\n\n### **Independence (9)** \n\nThe names of God in the group Independence include Self-Sufficient, Self-Subsisting, and Independent of All Worlds. It should be noted the Power group utilized the Name All-Sufficient. All-Sufficient demonstrates how God can suffice all things, whereas Self-Sufficient shows how God can suffice Himself without requiring any support from creation itself.\n\nGod has complete autonomy. God is independent of our own belief or exaltation. It also means God does not need anything in return in being Just, Almighty, All-Knowing, and Inaccessible. God acts only due to His own purpose. This purpose, this Cause, is solely for creation's benefit.\n\nThe next 10 groups include the quality of independence.\n\n### **Command (6)**\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas describes God as being the Commander, Ordainer, and Fulfiller. These names serve as the foundation for legislation and the exectution of this legislation. These roles in one way serves as the Word through which the entire framework of order, laws, directives, and intentions are used to shape the destiny of creation.\n\nIt would seem justice would require the command in practice. God cannot judge without establishing a standard to judge against. This would definitely be correct. With Commander being a Name of God, it is more about the attribute. In order for belief in God's command to exist, one must believe in the attribute of Justice first. Otherwise, a person would not follow the command.\n\nSubtlety is still the foundation here within Command. Even a simple outward command could have significant and profound spiritual meaning. Believing in the Command thus, isn't just merely acting on the command, but believing the Command itself has an inner essence full of mystery, spiritual progress, and deeper purpose within the grand scope of creation. The Command is bound within God's All-Knowing nature and serves as the framework not just for people, but for all creation. Command acts through God's Lordship and serves the balance of Justice. The Command is Exalted over any other command and is independent of everything other than God Himself.\n\nThe next 9 groups include the quality of command.\n\n### **Counsel (6)**\n\nThe group counsel is informed by the names Counselor, Speaker, and Source of Inspiration. Unlike Command which is more about legislation, Counsel is more about helping navigate complex moral, spiritual, and practical challenges which may not have a clear prohibition. This compliments Command.\n\nBelief in God as a Counselor means you believe God can provide you with advice and wisdom. The originates from God being Wise and All-Informed. God can do this as the Speaker, using His Word or Manifestations of His Word to provide guidance at anytime. This guidance could be sought or offered voluntarily. These counsels, advice, and wisdom act within God's name Source of Inspiration. The inspirations inspired could be inner understandings or renewed energies to act.\n\nCounsel interacts with Subtlety by allowing for a process of self-discovery through the hidden, inner dimensions of truth which may Manifest through Signs and Manifestations of God. While inspiration itself is a creation, effective counsel can help ensure a person may find harmony and balance within the framework of creation itself. Counsel could be highly contextual and individualized, which requires God's knowledge to ensure relevance and timeliness. God's counsel is authoritative as Lord and is another pathway to justice, as His counsel will be most fair and equitable. The Exalted nature of God ensures a sense of awe and respect for His wisdom. The counsel is effective through God's independence, ensuring the counsel is solely for the benefit of creation, not from any need or want.\n\nThe next 8 groups include the quality counsel.\n\n### **Faithfulness (3)**\n\nFaithfulness is a name or attribute rarely attributed to God, or at least in what I read and hear. Usually faithfulness is used only in the context of a person in relation to God or a significant loved one. This group is highlighted by the names in the Kitab-i-Aqdas of Trustworthy and Faithful Guardian.\n\nBelief in God as being Trustworthy is the result of believing God's counsel and command. You can trust God's command and counsel is not only wise, but upheld. They are not arbitrary or motivated in negative qualities such as selfishness. God can be relied upon in good times and in bad to exist within all the names expressed. God upholds His promises and fulfills His roles as Lord and Creator justly.\n\nGod is the Faithful Guardian. Being faithful, God is unwavering in His promises and in upholding justice. He is loyal to creation and being independent, is not affected by human actions or decisions. God being a guardian demonstrates an active role within creation. While God being Inaccessible may seem God is impersonal, this is quite far from the truth. Inaccessible is solely due to His exalted nature, not due to a lack of care or concern for creation. God is our guardian. Creation could face challenges, and God is able to protect it and guide it, ensuring it flourishes. Within humanity, God is like a shephard.\n\nBoth these names are a testament to the faithfulness of God, especially to each individual person although not exclusive to humanity. There is a steadfast commitment to our guidance, protection, and well-being. This should help encourage a sense of hope, trust, and gratitude in our own walks of faith.\n\nThe next 7 groups include the quality faithfulness.\n\n### **Praise (4)**\n\nGod's names in this group include All-Praised, Praised, and Praiseworthy. This demonstrates how created entities, not just humanity, praise God and His names. God is worthy of adoration due to how all of these prior names are manifested within creation.\n\nPraise can be for God's Subtlety, awe, and wonderment. The hidden aspects of God's nature invite reflection and admiration. Praise can be for God's manifestations, helping to connect humanity to the divine. Praise can be for God's omniscience, for understanding all things perfectly for the benefit of creation. Praise can be for creation itself, for its beauty, complexity, artistry, and magnificence. Praise can be for God's power and Lordship, for the ability to govern, sustain, and transform creation into constantly better versions. Praise can be for God's purpose and justice, for the assurance there is fairness and moral accountability. God deserves praise for being the Most High and Most Glorious, showing a deep reverence for His supreme nature. God can be praised for needing nothing but giving everything selflessly, being fully independent of creation. Praise is for God's command, providing a moral and spiritual framework for all. Praise for laws which promote growth, harmony, justice, and peace. Praise can be for God's counsel which ensures humanity can navigate life's challenges in a wise and caring way. Praise is for God's faithfulness in His consistent care and fulfillment of promises, for being steadfast in being an active part in developing our spiritual and material needs.\n\nThe next 6 groups include the quality of praise.\n\n### **Love (11)**\n\nThrough God's counsel and faithfulness, His love becomes apparent, nurturing a relationship between the Creator and creation.\n\n**Forgiveness (15)**:\\\nAs humans err, God's forgiving nature is revealed, highlighting His mercy and willingness to reconcile.\n\n**Mercy (29)**:\\\nBuilding on forgiveness, God's broader mercy is understood as an overarching quality encompassing all creation.\n\n**Generosity (22)**:\\\nGod's mercy extends to acts of generosity, as He bestows gifts and blessings upon humanity.\n\n**Sovereignty (4)**:\\\nRecognizing God's sovereignty crowns this progression, affirming His ultimate control over all realms.\n\n**Purity (9)**:\\\nFinally, the journey culminates in understanding God's absolute purity and truth, the zenith of the divine attributes.\n\n## Attributes and Names of God\n\n### Most excellent names and supreme attributes\n\n-   All-Bountiful - 1\n-   All-Capable - 1\n-   All-Encompassing - 1\n-   All-Forgiving - 1\n-   All-Hearing - 1\n-   All-Informed - 8\n-   All-Knowing - 28\n-   Almighty - 15\n-   All-Merciful - 10\n-   All-Possessing - 2\n-   All-Powerful - 8\n-   All-Praised - 1\n-   All-Seeing - 1\n-   All-Subduing - 2\n-   All-Sufficient - 1\n-   All-Wise - 9\n-   Ancient - 3\n-   Avenger - 1\n-   Beloved - 5\n-   Bestower - 4\n-   Bountiful - 2\n-   Chosen - 3\n-   Commander - 1\n-   Compassionate - 2\n-   Counselor - 2\n-   Creator of the Earth and Heavens - 6\n-   Dawning Place of Signs - 1\n-   Ever-Abiding - 3\n-   Ever-Forgiving - 1\n-   Everlasting - 3\n-   Exalted - 8\n-   Faithful Guardian - 1\n-   Firm - 1\n-   Forgiving - 12\n-   Fulfiller - 1\n-   Generous - 10\n-   Grace - 1\n-   Gracious - 1\n-   Great - 1\n-   Greatest Infallibility - 1\n-   *Inaccessible - 1*\n-   Independent of All Worlds - 3\n-   Judge - 4\n-   Just - 1\n-   Knower of All Things - 1\n-   Lord - 14\n-   Lord of all Beings - 3\n-   Lord of Beauty - 1\n-   Lord of Bounty - 1\n-   Lord of all Creation - 3\n-   Lord of Decree - 1\n-   Lord of Destiny - 1\n-   Lord of Dominion - 1\n-   Lord of your Forefathers - 2\n-   Lord of Grace - 1\n-   Lord of Grandeur - 1\n-   Lord of Humankind - 2\n-   Lord of Innovation - 2\n-   Lord of the Last and the First - 1\n-   Lord of Majesty - 1\n-   Lord of Names - 3\n-   Lord of Origin - 2\n-   Lord of All Religions - 1\n-   Lord of Return - 2\n-   Lord of the Seen - 2\n-   Lord of Sovereignty - 1\n-   Lord of Splendor - 1\n-   Lord of the Throne - 1\n-   Lord of the Unseen - 2\n-   Lord of the Worlds - 7\n-   Loving - 1\n-   Majestic - 2\n-   *Manifest - 1*\n-   *Manifestation of the Signs - 1*\n-   Master - 1\n-   Merciful - 10\n-   Mighty - 6\n-   Most Bountiful - 2\n-   Most Compassionate - 1\n-   Most Exalted - 1\n-   Most Generous - 3\n-   Most Glorious - 1\n-   Most High - 1\n-   Most Merciful - 6\n-   Merciful - 11\n-   Mighty - 17\n-   Oft-Forgiving - 1\n-   One - 4\n-   Ordainer - 3\n-   Possessor of all Names - 1\n-   Powerful One - 2\n-   Praised - 1\n-   Praiseworthy - 2\n-   Provider of all Means - 1\n-   Purest - 1\n-   Reckoner - 1\n-   Revealer of the Verses - 2\n-   Ruler - 1\n-   Self-Subsisting - 3\n-   Self-Sufficient - 3\n-   Source of Inspiration - 1\n-   Sovereign - 4\n-   Speaker - 1\n-   *Subtle - 1*\n-   Subduer - 1\n-   True - 6\n-   Trustworthy - 2\n-   Wise - 9\n-   Wondrous - 1\n-   Worshiped One - 1\n\n## No Partner as the Greatest Infallibility\n\nGod has reserved this station for Himself.

When combined with the name Inaccessible, we can start to imagine God's mysterious and hidden nature. God may seem unable to be directly observed, or to some, lacking in direct evidence or proof. Yet, these qualities are highly nuanced. Subtlety can be viewed as an interweaving of words, meanings, ideas, and feelings which language may not be able to fully convey, or the conveyance can be completely relative to the contexts of time, space, and perspective. In one moment you may have an understanding and in the next, you gain a different understanding.\n\nThere are hundreds of traditions which attempt to explain who God is through art, music, dance, and poetic stories. They are filled with metaphor, exaggerated expressions, and other methods in an attempt to express the mystery which is God. Each are expressions of the subtlety of God, when all taken together are a divine tapestry whose threads are interwoven in truth and a shared experience along a spiritual journey. This also means there is more than one way to experience God. The Kitab-i-Aqdas provides the framework to open up these experiences, to find the different pathways to explore the hidden nature of God. All one must do is seek, to be a seeker.\n\nThe next 18 groups include the quality of Subtlety.\n\n### **Manifestation (2)**\n\nOne way God assists the seeker is by manifesting signs that hint at His presence. The purpose is to make the inaccessible more accessible, even if it isn't accessibility in God's entirety. These signs might not be obvious like a stop sign, but could be more like being nearsighted as you approach a highway sign pointing to multiple paths.

They could come from others like ourselves through their actions, thoughts, and feelings. They could even come from our own imagination or subconscious, such as with a dream. A seeker may not observe every sign and when a sign is observed, may not understand the significance of the sign completely. A person who is not seeking may not even be aware there are signs.

A human Manifestation of God is a reflection and embodiment of God Himself. This will go into deeper detail regarding Manifestations of God in the chapter \"Belief in the Manifestation of God.\"\n\nThe next 17 groups include the quality of Manifestation.\n\n### **Knowledge (46)**\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas uses the names such as All-Knowing, All-Informed, Wise, and the Knower of All Things frequently. These words conveys God's own infinite knowledge, a knowledge when Manifested is all full of Subtlety. Sometimes the knowledge may seem inaccessible or difficult to understand. This is an acceptable perspective. Sometimes knowledge is entirely based on perspective, especially within space and time.

This knowledge leads to God being the Wise, knowing how to apply knowledge in the best way possible.\n\nThe next 16 groups include the quality of Knowledge.\n\n### **Creation (6)**\n\nGod's names include the Dawning Place of Signs and the Creator of the Earth and Heavens. Creation is manifested through God's Knowledge. God's role as Creator begins to become evident, showing how His knowledge shapes and sustains the universe.\n\nWith God being the creator, is also demonstrates God's eternal preexistence.

These names include the Almighty, All-Powerful, All-Capable, All-Subduing, and All-Sufficient. Each of these names express a different mode or aspect of God as Power. With God being the Creator, an awareness of God's Power and omnipotence follows.\n\nMight can be synonymous with strength, especially with the traditional notions of being able to exert a great amount of force. Power can be viewed in how strength can be projected, or the ability to exert influence. Being capable is the ability to get things done, especially through skill. Subduing is being able to express one's Will over another. Being All-Sufficient means being qualified and competent in using power to achieve the required goals and to fulfill purpose.\n\nThese names all demonstrate God's ability to govern and sustain all which has been created. Notice how Power comes after other attributes such as being All-Knowing. Knowledge leads to Power. Power itself does not lead to being All-Knowing. This shows, in a way, how being Almighty or All-Subduing can be quite nuanced by Subtlety. Skill in using might and power involves knowing what tools to use, or exactly the right amount of energy to achieve the purpose within creation. The use of power might be a challenge to understand, as is understanding God's Will, which is a Will that subdues all of creation. The Will of God could be quite difficult to comprehend or fathom, also being a part of the greater mystery of God. There is hidden strength, such as how fine-tuned the laws of physics are or how life seemingly came from inert matter. Power does not need to be coercive but instead influential, such as in the role to guide hearts or establish those natural laws. The rotation of the planets or the growth of a seed show how God can invisibly utilize power. There doesn't need to be extravagant, one-time shows of might for power to be manifested. Because God manifests the Signs, power does not need to be a show of domination, but a gentle way to empower creation to flourish. Dramatic interventions are always possible with God if it serves a purpose, and whether they are dramatic or subtle, the power is always transformative.\n\nThe next 14 groups include the quality of power.\n\n### **Lordship (51)** \n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas includes many different ways in describing the various ways God is Lord. The title of Lord is used to describe concepts such as the Lord of Beauty, of all Religion, of Grandeur, of the Seen and Unseen. Lordship can be defined as God's ultimate authority. This authority would be over all creation and is derived from God's knowledge and power. Lordship can discuss authority and governance. This authority is absolute, encompassing everything which is seen and unseen. Lordship is universal, transcending all divisions, stations, ranks, and beliefs.\n\nGod is the ruler over all creation, although as God is Subtlety, Lordship can also be a mystery. Lordship might be observed through the Manifestation of Signs, understood through Knowledge, witnessed through Creation, and felt through Power.\n\nThe next 13 groups include the quality of lordship.\n\n### **Justice (6)** \n\nJustice is expressed through the names Judge, Just, and Reckoner. Justice can often be seen as the determination between right and wrong. It can also be viewed as the balance expressed through God's Lordship. Although justice can often be immediately evident, Subtlety allows for justice to be precise, operating beyond the surface. This includes realities which can seem hidden, such as intentions, unseen consequences, or other spiritual conditions.\n\nJustice can be witnessed through the various signs manifested, especially in how perfectly ordered creation is. Justice requires the omniscience of God to truly be balanced, informed of every action, intention, and consequence. Justice is the fulfillment of the purpose of creation in an equitable way. Justice requires God's power to be upheld. Power without justice can become tyranny. Justice ensures power is fair and equitable. All of creation benefits from justice.\n\nGod as an All-Capable Reckoner is able to calculate and account for all actions, intentions, and consequences, to include those seemingly unknown. God as the All-Knowing Judge determines the best rulings according to divine principles. Judgment and reckoning are required for justice to be implemented. As Lord, God's justice becomes evident as does order within His governance.\n\nThe next 12 groups include the quality of justice.\n\n### **Exaltation (9)**\n\nGod's justice demonstrates God's exalted nature. The names of Most Exalted, Most High, Great, Majestic, Most Glorious, and the Greatest Infallibility come from God's role as Just. Without justice, God's Power, Lordship, and Knowledge would be unworthy of exaltation. However, because of God's Justice, nothing else in creation can be more exalted than God.\n\nGiven God's Knowledge and Power, the Name of Greatest Infallibility demonstrates the fairness and righteousness of justice, showing that God does not and will not error. God's Subtlety can make His Exaltation seem veiled, especially when compared to more superficial things we can place above ourselves, or when we place ourselves above everything. Subtlety is what creates awe and acknowledges the extraordinary nature, despite being incomprehensible. The Manifestation of the Signs and of God help reveal different aspects of God's exalted nature.\n\nThe belief in God's Exaltation is not because God feels jealousy if you do not, nor needs to be exalted to feel good. The belief in God's Exaltation is a function of God's Lordship and Justice above any other form of justice and authority.\n\nThe next 11 groups include the quality of exaltation.\n\n### **Independence (9)** \n\nThe names of God in the group Independence include Self-Sufficient, Self-Subsisting, and Independent of All Worlds. It should be noted the Power group utilized the Name All-Sufficient. All-Sufficient demonstrates how God can suffice all things, whereas Self-Sufficient shows how God can suffice Himself without requiring any support from creation itself.\n\nGod has complete autonomy. God is independent of our own belief or exaltation. It also means God does not need anything in return in being Just, Almighty, All-Knowing, and Inaccessible. God acts only due to His own purpose. This purpose, this Cause, is solely for creation's benefit.\n\nThe next 10 groups include the quality of independence.\n\n### **Command (6)**\n\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas describes God as being the Commander, Ordainer, and Fulfiller. These names serve as the foundation for legislation and the exectution of this legislation. These roles in one way serves as the Word through which the entire framework of order, laws, directives, and intentions are used to shape the destiny of creation.\n\nIt would seem justice would require the command in practice. God cannot judge without establishing a standard to judge against. This would definitely be correct. With Commander being a Name of God, it is more about the attribute. In order for belief in God's command to exist, one must believe in the attribute of Justice first. Otherwise, a person would not follow the command.\n\nSubtlety is still the foundation here within Command. Even a simple outward command could have significant and profound spiritual meaning. Believing in the Command thus, isn't just merely acting on the command, but believing the Command itself has an inner essence full of mystery, spiritual progress, and deeper purpose within the grand scope of creation. The Command is bound within God's All-Knowing nature and serves as the framework not just for people, but for all creation. Command acts through God's Lordship and serves the balance of Justice. The Command is Exalted over any other command and is independent of everything other than God Himself.\n\nThe next 9 groups include the quality of command.\n\n### **Counsel (6)**\n\nThe group counsel is informed by the names Counselor, Speaker, and Source of Inspiration. Unlike Command which is more about legislation, Counsel is more about helping navigate complex moral, spiritual, and practical challenges which may not have a clear prohibition. This compliments Command.\n\nBelief in God as a Counselor means you believe God can provide you with advice and wisdom. The originates from God being Wise and All-Informed. God can do this as the Speaker, using His Word or Manifestations of His Word to provide guidance at anytime. This guidance could be sought or offered voluntarily. These counsels, advice, and wisdom act within God's name Source of Inspiration. The inspirations inspired could be inner understandings or renewed energies to act.\n\nCounsel interacts with Subtlety by allowing for a process of self-discovery through the hidden, inner dimensions of truth which may Manifest through Signs and Manifestations of God. While inspiration itself is a creation, effective counsel can help ensure a person may find harmony and balance within the framework of creation itself. Counsel could be highly contextual and individualized, which requires God's knowledge to ensure relevance and timeliness. God's counsel is authoritative as Lord and is another pathway to justice, as His counsel will be most fair and equitable. The Exalted nature of God ensures a sense of awe and respect for His wisdom. The counsel is effective through God's independence, ensuring the counsel is solely for the benefit of creation, not from any need or want.\n\nThe next 8 groups include the quality counsel.\n\n### **Faithfulness (3)**\n\nFaithfulness is a name or attribute rarely attributed to God, or at least in what I read and hear. Usually faithfulness is used only in the context of a person in relation to God or a significant loved one. This group is highlighted by the names in the Kitab-i-Aqdas of Trustworthy and Faithful Guardian.\n\nBelief in God as being Trustworthy is the result of believing God's counsel and command. You can trust God's command and counsel is not only wise, but upheld. They are not arbitrary or motivated in negative qualities such as selfishness. God can be relied upon in good times and in bad to exist within all the names expressed. God upholds His promises and fulfills His roles as Lord and Creator justly.\n\nGod is the Faithful Guardian. Being faithful, God is unwavering in His promises and in upholding justice. He is loyal to creation and being independent, is not affected by human actions or decisions. God being a guardian demonstrates an active role within creation. While God being Inaccessible may seem God is impersonal, this is quite far from the truth. Inaccessible is solely due to His exalted nature, not due to a lack of care or concern for creation. God is our guardian. Creation could face challenges, and God is able to protect it and guide it, ensuring it flourishes. Within humanity, God is like a shephard.\n\nBoth these names are a testament to the faithfulness of God, especially to each individual person although not exclusive to humanity. There is a steadfast commitment to our guidance, protection, and well-being. This should help encourage a sense of hope, trust, and gratitude in our own walks of faith.\n\nThe next 7 groups include the quality faithfulness.\n\n### **Praise (4)**\n\nGod's names in this group include All-Praised, Praised, and Praiseworthy. This demonstrates how created entities, not just humanity, praise God and His names. God is worthy of adoration due to how all of these prior names are manifested within creation.\n\nPraise can be for God's Subtlety, awe, and wonderment. The hidden aspects of God's nature invite reflection and admiration. Praise can be for God's manifestations, helping to connect humanity to the divine. Praise can be for God's omniscience, for understanding all things perfectly for the benefit of creation. Praise can be for creation itself, for its beauty, complexity, artistry, and magnificence. Praise can be for God's power and Lordship, for the ability to govern, sustain, and transform creation into constantly better versions. Praise can be for God's purpose and justice, for the assurance there is fairness and moral accountability. God deserves praise for being the Most High and Most Glorious, showing a deep reverence for His supreme nature. God can be praised for needing nothing but giving everything selflessly, being fully independent of creation. Praise is for God's command, providing a moral and spiritual framework for all. Praise for laws which promote growth, harmony, justice, and peace. Praise can be for God's counsel which ensures humanity can navigate life's challenges in a wise and caring way. Praise is for God's faithfulness in His consistent care and fulfillment of promises, for being steadfast in being an active part in developing our spiritual and material needs.\n\nThe next 6 groups include the quality of praise.\n\n### **Love (11)**\n\nThrough God's counsel and faithfulness, His love becomes apparent, nurturing a relationship between the Creator and creation.\n\n**Forgiveness (15)**:\\\nAs humans err, God's forgiving nature is revealed, highlighting His mercy and willingness to reconcile.\n\n**Mercy (29)**:\\\nBuilding on forgiveness, God's broader mercy is understood as an overarching quality encompassing all creation.\n\n**Generosity (22)**:\\\nGod's mercy extends to acts of generosity, as He bestows gifts and blessings upon humanity.\n\n**Sovereignty (4)**:\\\nRecognizing God's sovereignty crowns this progression, affirming His ultimate control over all realms.\n\n**Purity (9)**:\\\nFinally, the journey culminates in understanding God's absolute purity and truth, the zenith of the divine attributes.\n\n## Attributes and Names of God\n\n### Most excellent names and supreme attributes\n\n-   All-Bountiful - 1\n-   All-Capable - 1\n-   All-Encompassing - 1\n-   All-Forgiving - 1\n-   All-Hearing - 1\n-   All-Informed - 8\n-   All-Knowing - 28\n-   Almighty - 15\n-   All-Merciful - 10\n-   All-Possessing - 2\n-   All-Powerful - 8\n-   All-Praised - 1\n-   All-Seeing - 1\n-   All-Subduing - 2\n-   All-Sufficient - 1\n-   All-Wise - 9\n-   Ancient - 3\n-   Avenger - 1\n-   Beloved - 5\n-   Bestower - 4\n-   Bountiful - 2\n-   Chosen - 3\n-   Commander - 1\n-   Compassionate - 2\n-   Counselor - 2\n-   Creator of the Earth and Heavens - 6\n-   Dawning Place of Signs - 1\n-   Ever-Abiding - 3\n-   Ever-Forgiving - 1\n-   Everlasting - 3\n-   Exalted - 8\n-   Faithful Guardian - 1\n-   Firm - 1\n-   Forgiving - 12\n-   Fulfiller - 1\n-   Generous - 10\n-   Grace - 1\n-   Gracious - 1\n-   Great - 1\n-   Greatest Infallibility - 1\n-   *Inaccessible - 1*\n-   Independent of All Worlds - 3\n-   Judge - 4\n-   Just - 1\n-   Knower of All Things - 1\n-   Lord - 14\n-   Lord of all Beings - 3\n-   Lord of Beauty - 1\n-   Lord of Bounty - 1\n-   Lord of all Creation - 3\n-   Lord of Decree - 1\n-   Lord of Destiny - 1\n-   Lord of Dominion - 1\n-   Lord of your Forefathers - 2\n-   Lord of Grace - 1\n-   Lord of Grandeur - 1\n-   Lord of Humankind - 2\n-   Lord of Innovation - 2\n-   Lord of the Last and the First - 1\n-   Lord of Majesty - 1\n-   Lord of Names - 3\n-   Lord of Origin - 2\n-   Lord of All Religions - 1\n-   Lord of Return - 2\n-   Lord of the Seen - 2\n-   Lord of Sovereignty - 1\n-   Lord of Splendor - 1\n-   Lord of the Throne - 1\n-   Lord of the Unseen - 2\n-   Lord of the Worlds - 7\n-   Loving - 1\n-   Majestic - 2\n-   *Manifest - 1*\n-   *Manifestation of the Signs - 1*\n-   Master - 1\n-   Merciful - 10\n-   Mighty - 6\n-   Most Bountiful - 2\n-   Most Compassionate - 1\n-   Most Exalted - 1\n-   Most Generous - 3\n-   Most Glorious - 1\n-   Most High - 1\n-   Most Merciful - 6\n-   Merciful - 11\n-   Mighty - 17\n-   Oft-Forgiving - 1\n-   One - 4\n-   Ordainer - 3\n-   Possessor of all Names - 1\n-   Powerful One - 2\n-   Praised - 1\n-   Praiseworthy - 2\n-   Provider of all Means - 1\n-   Purest - 1\n-   Reckoner - 1\n-   Revealer of the Verses - 2\n-   Ruler - 1\n-   Self-Subsisting - 3\n-   Self-Sufficient - 3\n-   Source of Inspiration - 1\n-   Sovereign - 4\n-   Speaker - 1\n-   *Subtle - 1*\n-   Subduer - 1\n-   True - 6\n-   Trustworthy - 2\n-   Wise - 9\n-   Wondrous - 1\n-   Worshiped One - 1\n\n## No Partner as the Greatest Infallibility\n\nGod has reserved this station for Himself.
