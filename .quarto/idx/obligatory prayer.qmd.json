In Questions and Answers, Baha'u'llah defines the age of maturity to be 15 years old for all people. This means anyone under 15 years old should not be expected, required, or forced to pray, even if you are the parent of a child under 15 years old.\n\nPrayer is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to.\n\nA woman who is menstrating does not have to perform obligatory prayer nor fast. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase \"Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty\" 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon.\n\nThe prayers, whether obligatory or not, are to be done on an individual basis and in private. The emphasis is the individual's relationship with God and their individual spiritual journey. The exception to this is the Prayer for the Dead. All of these can be done in your native language, or any language you know where you understand what is being said.\n\n## Preparation for Prayer\n\nAblutions are required in preparation for prayer. An ablution is the washing of your hands and face with water. If ablutions cannot be performed, the short prayer should be offered to God prior to the obligatory prayer \"In the Name of God, the Purest, the Purest\" five times.\n\n## Length of Prayer\n\nThe length of the obligatory prayer was to consist of nine rak'ahs. A rak'ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha'u'llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.\n\n## Time of Day\n\nThe obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\n\nThe small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.\n\nFor believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable. For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.\n\nDepending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha'u'llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.\n\nAs God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.\n\nNo matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.\n\n## Direction of Prayer\n\nThe direction of obligatory prayer is called the Qiblih, or the point of adoration. As the point is currently the point where the Sun of Truth and Explanation had set, this would be the mansion of Bahji in present day Acre, Israel.\n\nAs a simple sidenote, Acre is one of the world's longest continuously lived settlements, going back to the Bronze Age. It also served as the final stronghold for Christian Crusaders before they were defeated by the Mamluks. Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.\n\nToday, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don't have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect. For prayers which are not obligatory, a believer can face in any direction. God is in all directions.\n\n## The Prayer for the Dead\n\nThe prayer for the dead provides for two options. The first option is to recite the full prayer revealed. There is a version for the male deceased and another for the female deceased. The second option exists if the believer has not remembered the full prayer. This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.\n\nThe Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.\n\n## The Recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá\n\nEach day, the recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá (God is Most Glorious) is to be done 95 times while facing the Qiblih. Ablutions need to be done prior.\n\n## No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing\n\nA person can wear their hair as they wish. Baha'u'llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha'u'llah states these rules were not in the Qur'an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish.\n\nI believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha'u'llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.\n\nA female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.\n\nThe clothes worn for prayer must be clean.\n\n## Clean Flooring\n\nFor prostration, Baha'u'llah allows for any clean surface. This does mean the surface must be clean. A person may use a clean prayer rug, but a prayer rug is not required. You could be on an old wooden flooring and it is acceptable if it is clean. You could be on the finest marble and it is acceptable if it is clean. Once again, the idea is for prayer to be accessible and focused on the spirit, not the material.\n\n## In Times of Exceptional Natural Phenomena\n\nThe Bab had outlined a specific prayer for the signs, or natural phenomena. Baha'u'llah has abrogated this and says we only need to say, \"\"Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.\"\n\nThe verse is a great reminder in times of fear and distress. Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.\n\n## During Travel\n\nDuring travel, obligatory prayer may be replaced while taking rest. The first option is to do a single prostration on a clean surface and recite \"Glory be to God, the Lord of Grandeur and Majesty, of Bounty and Grace.\" If one is unable to find a clean surface or is unable to prostrate for any reason, the second option is to say \"Glory be to God.\"\n\nAfter the prostration, sit in the position of unity. I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say \"Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty\" 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.\n\nIt should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer. This can, at a minimum, take just a minute although the length can vary depending on how you recite the prayer.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Who is Required to Pray\n\nThe age of maturity is the age when a believer is first required to pray, as well as other religious duties.
