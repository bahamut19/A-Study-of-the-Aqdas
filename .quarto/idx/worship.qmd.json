Repentance is only to be sought for by yourself and with God only. Also associated with this act of worship is the prohibition from kissing the hands of another person in an attempt to seek forgiveness.\n\nNo person can determine if you are saved, condemned, or any other form of divine judgment. God is Mighty and Forgiving. There are no exclusions based on any act, any perspective, or the like. The Aqdas does say the first command is about believing, which without belief makes you in error no matter what good deed you do. Without belief, you wouldn't even seek forgiveness from God. From who then, would grant you heaven?\n\n## Reflection\n\nReflect, during the dawn and evening, on the mercy and favors of God.

The House is defined as the house where Baha'u'llah lived in Bahji, at Acre. The men are to be able-bodied and have the means to do so. If a man is not able to, it will not be held against him. Women are not required to, but are also allowed to if they so choose.\n\nThis difference in ruling is not about gender inequality, or saying women are less able to perform pilgrimage. This is about women having less of an obligation in God's eyes to perform a task. This is about mercy and generosity.\n\n## Engaging in an Occupation\n\nEngaging in an occupation is an act of worship. The purpose is to engage in activities that benefit yourself and others. This requires trusting in God, who is the provider.\n\nNotice the purpose of the occupation is not necessarily to become wealthy, although wealth is one mode to benefit yourself and others. The goal is to find a way to benefit others and trust in God to provide.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Remembrance\n\nOf God\n\nOf Baha'u'llah\n\nExalt the Lord with joy and gladness\n\nMagnify the Lord with Joy and gladness\n\nGlorify the Lord with Joy and gladness\n\nRejoice in the joy of the Greatest Name, by which hearts are enraptured and the minds of the near ones are attracted.\n\nThank Him with joy and spiritual fragrance\n\nMusic is a ladder for the ascent of souls to the highest horizon\n\nWhoever is enraptured by the love of My name, the Merciful, shall recite the verses of God in such a manner that the hearts of those who slumber will be moved.\n\nThose who recite the verses of the Most Merciful with the most melodious tones, they perceive from them that which no dominion of the heavens and the earth can equal, and through them they discover the fragrance of My worlds, which today are known only to those endowed with vision from this exalted station.
