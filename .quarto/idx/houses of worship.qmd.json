Moving music, rhythmic chanting, impassioned praise, and a welcoming community which embraces everyone who comes in as one of their own. There is no judgment, no absolute set way to do things, and no particular script to follow. The remembrance of God is not limited to form or tradition, and when sincerely moved by the Spirit, will always attract the hearts and souls.\n\n## Purpose of the House\n\nThe purpose of the House in the Name of the Lord of all Religions is for hearts to be illumined and eyes are comforted. God is the ultimate Lamp, and for a person to witness others who act as though they have the light of God within them is inspiring. It helps to feel that God is active in the hearts of the assembly and in the heart of the community.\n\nWhen it feels as though God is operating within the assembly, it also moves the heart in a way which gives peace and comfort. It is impossible not to be touched if you are seeking God as your Beloved. The Spirit working through the House and the assembly is a Spirit which can bring hope regardless of the circumstances in life. The Spirit can help inspire pathways for believers to act in the commands of God at home, at work, and within their relationships with family, friends, coworkers, and whomever you may cross paths with.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe assemblies of creation, or at least anywhere where believers do assemble, are commanded to build houses in the Name of the Lord of all Religions.
