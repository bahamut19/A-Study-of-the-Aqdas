title: "Honoring God"
---

## Introduction

In the opening of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, which frames the purpose of the Book, Baha'u'llah says "The tongue of My power has spoken in the dominion of My greatness, addressing My creation: “Carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.” Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner."[^honoring-god-1] This places an important context for our spiritual practice. Every command is to be carried out of love.

[^honoring-god-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #4

This love is not one-way. In Chapter 1 we learned how one of God's names is Love and Beloved. God's love not only burns away the veils[^honoring-god-2] which prevent the soul from being a true mirror, it is also the key to the hidden treasure.[^honoring-god-3] The hidden treasure is the liberation of the soul. Created noble, the soul is born already bearing honor, a sign of God's hope that each one may rise to the seat of divine nobility.

[^honoring-god-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #132

[^honoring-god-3]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #15

Honor is the condition of being uplifted by God's love. God desires that every soul may turn in their hearts to a seat of honor and nobility.[^honoring-god-4] Although God does not need us to uplift Him, there are ways we can honor our love of the Beloved. When this book transitions to the various ordinances, these are all pathways to honor God's love for us and to express love for God. These pathways are ways to live in alignment with divine truth, pathways to that hidden treasure. Some of these pathways I feel are rather spiritual in nature and key components to our spiritual practice, hence naming this spiritual practice as honoring God.

[^honoring-god-4]: Lawh-i-Madinat'ut-Tawhid (Tablet of the City of Unity)

This chapter will introduce various aspects of honoring God through individual and social acts of devotion. Some are woven into the rhythm of the Badi calendar, a sacred cycle of 19 months, fasts, and festivals, while others are more spontaneous acts of devotion. These are practices which form the bedrock of the spiritual identity of a community. In honoring God, we begin to walk the path of law not as burden, but as love made visible.

## Build the Mashriq'ul-Adhkar

The Mashriq'ul-Adhkar means the Dawning Place of the Remembrance of God. It is every house built for the remembrance in cities and villages.[^honoring-god-5] These houses are to be built in the name of the Lord of all religions.[^honoring-god-6] They are to be built as perfectly as possible. They are to be adorned with that which befits them, not with images and likenesses. The Dawning Place has chambers, where children may recite the verses in the best melodies.[^honoring-god-7] They should be established with wisdom, so that its building does not cause conflict.[^honoring-god-8] For example, Baha'u'llah advised the community of Tehran and some others to wait to establish the Mashriq-ul-Adhkar. Baha'u'llah says:

[^honoring-god-5]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #115

[^honoring-god-6]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #31

[^honoring-god-7]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #150

[^honoring-god-8]: BH00054

> "Blessed is the hive, the house, the station, the city, the heart, the mountain, the cave, the sanctuary, the wilderness, the land, the sea, the island, and the dwelling where the mention and praise of God have been raised."

While being perfect, they also do not need to be extravagant. For example, Jinab-i-'Aziz and Mirza Muhammad Kazim established Mashriq-ul-Adhkars at their houses. Their perfection was not the wealth used to build them nor world renowned architects. The perfection was from the love, devotion, sincerity, and purity of intention used in their creation and use.

Baha'u'llah says we should "turn towards the Dawning Place at dawn, reflecting, remembering, reflecting, and seeking forgiveness. Remembrance should be with spirit and fragrance. When we enter, we should sit in silence, listening to the verses of God." This implies the presence of someone reciting the verses of God aloud.

With Baha'u'llah himself being the breaker of dawn, the Mashriq'ul-Adhkar is designed to represent the dawn within each of us who enter it, and perhaps the dawn of God's love in every city and village where one is built. The Mashriq-ul-Adhkar also are symbols of the houses where revelation started, such as the Bab's house in Shiraz and Baha'u'llah's house in Baghdad. Each visit, in a way, can be as a pilgrimage.

The Mashriq-ul-Adhkar is the foundation of the spiritual life of the community, honoring God as they feel within their liberating souls. If many people were to attend at dawn, you would have an opportunity for congregational remembrance. As remembrance is to be in melodious tones, there could be music. Baha'u'llah "remember(s) those who gathered or will gather to serve God, that they may rejoice and be among the thankful. Upon them are My glory, My remembrance, and My praise."[^honoring-god-9]

[^honoring-god-9]: BH00230

As there would be chambers, there are also opportunities for private remembrance. The choice could be yours, depending on how your spirit needs that day. Remembrance in the Dawning Place is not required in the evenings, but I could see if a person wanted to do their evening remembrance in a Dawning Place, that should be an option. The Mashriq’ul-Adhkár is the heartbeat of a community’s spiritual life, built not to impose rituals, but to invite liberation. Whether for solitary prayer or congregational praise, whether sung in melody or whispered in longing, it honors God in a way each soul recognizes as home.

## Pilgrimage

The Kitab-i-Aqdas enjoins pilgrimage to the Sacred House.[^honoring-god-10] I like to think of the Sacred House as a recurring station in sacred history, much like how the title Manifestation of God has been fulfilled by many people. The Sacred House is where revelation first dawned. When the revelation of the Bab was first fulfilled, the House was the Bab's home in Shiraz, Iran. When the revelation of Baha'u'llah was first announced, the House was Baha'u'llah's home in Baghdad, Iraq. Baha'u'llah revealed two pilgrimage tablets for both Sacred Houses.

[^honoring-god-10]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #32

The purpose of pilgrimage is a way to physically portray the spiritual journey to God. As such, this way to honor God is quite sacred. There is no time frame, no schedule, no permission, nor any tour guides to point the way or tell you what to do. Pilgrimage is not an act of tourism. It is solely an act of devotion. I like to think of it that God desires to welcome you to His house and you are the honored guest. As an act of hospitality, God will provide for whatever you actually need for the nourishment and comfort of the soul.

The pilgrimage is for only those who are able to. Any able-bodied man who is able to perform pilgrimage should as long as it does not cause financial hardship. Women are exempt. This does not mean a woman cannot do pilgrimage, but there is no penalty or judgment by God if an able-bodied woman with financial means does not do pilgrimage.

Baha'u'llah also allowed a person who desired to conduct pilgrimage, but was unable to, for Himself to fulfill the pilgrimage requirement.[^honoring-god-11] Today, visiting the Sacred House is not fully possible. Both houses no longer stand and the land is used for other purposes. However, pilgrimage is still partially possible. I have not done so yet, but it is my hope to visit one of locations. In the tablets Baha'u'llah revealed for pilgrimage, the Suriy-i-Hajj I (Shiraz) and II (Baghdad), there are prayers and acts one can take leading up to arriving to the location where the Houses stood. If I am unable to, I do hope that I may do so in a dream or in some other meditative state.

[^honoring-god-11]: BH00250

## Rights of God (Ḥuqúqu’lláh)

The Rights of God, also known as Ḥuqúqu’lláh, is a way to honor God through the purification of wealth.[^honoring-god-12] The Bab had initially introduced the Rights of God in Vahid 5, Gate 19 of the Bayan. In the Bayan, the Rights of God were assigned to He Whom God Shall Make Manifest, and fulfilled through Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah says the purpose is to bring people to higher stations. Baha'u'llah describes the payment as mandatory, saying not to withhold ourselves from this great bounty. If the Huquq was not paid with joy and radiance, Baha'u'llah would not accept it.[^honoring-god-13]

[^honoring-god-12]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #97

[^honoring-god-13]: BH00214

The Rights of God is paid solely from wealth, not income. If one's wealth reaches 100 mithqáls (425g) of gold, 19 mithqáls (80.75g) thereof belong to God. Basically it is a 19% contribution. In a letter to Jinab-i-Samandar[^honoring-god-14] Baha'u'llah explains there is a minimum amount upon which the Huquq is paid, which is 19 mithqáls (80.75g). Wealth is similar to a balance sheet of a business. You take assets, subtract liabilities, and you end up with total equity. Once the Huquq has been paid on a portion of wealth, that portion is not subject to payment again. When a new 19 mithqáls is reached, a new 19% payment is required. Endowments for charity are also a part of the Huquq'u'llah[^honoring-god-15]

[^honoring-god-14]: BH00077

[^honoring-god-15]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #42

Baha'u'llah would use the Rights of God to take care of the affairs of the believers, as these things require money. These affairs included teaching[^honoring-god-16], taking care of the poor[^honoring-god-17], prisoners, travel, and other affairs. He had instructed an unspecified woman to give two-thirds of the Huquq'u'llah for good works, and one-third to the Holy Court, which was to Baha'u'llah.[^honoring-god-18] In another letter, He says all of it can be paid for charity.[^honoring-god-19] It seems there was no rigid methodology in how Huquq'u'llah was used. The Kitab-i-Aqdas also specifies endowments can be used for elevated places, which could be the two Houses to be established in every city, such as the Mashriq'ul-Adhkar and the House of Justice.

[^honoring-god-16]: BH00234

[^honoring-god-17]: BH00086

[^honoring-god-18]: BH00158

[^honoring-god-19]: BH00261

For those who collected the Rights of God, He warned not to betray the Rights of God. This means not to use it for personal gain or any other action which goes against the Revelation. Baha'u'llah required a collector to provide a receipt and to keep records about how each Huquq payment was dispersed. Financial accountability is guaranteed. Eventually, Baha'u'llah enjoins the Trustees of the Houses of Justice to receive and present the Rights of God.[^honoring-god-20]

[^honoring-god-20]: BH00282

This way to honor God is a pathway to honor the rest of the People of Baha, as it is the primary way to be able to afford the care of each other and the care of the Cause of God.

## Engaging in an Occupation

Related to the Rights of God, Baha'u'llah wants us to honor God through engaging in an occupation.[^honoring-god-21] Working is equivalent to worship. The purpose is to engage in activities which benefit yourself and others. The purpose is not necessarily to gain wealth solely for your own pleasures and comforts. He says in BH10890 "Blessed is he who beareth burdens but causeth none to bear his own. Let him engage in craft and profession - a single coin earned thereby is, in the sight of God, more beloved than the treasure that is gathered unrightfully and made ready."

[^honoring-god-21]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #33

Working is a responsibility. When Baha'u'llah says a blessed person does not cause burdens for another, this can be viewed in various ways. For example, maybe you own a business and employ a person. Paying a wage which keeps the employee in poverty could be a burden. Another way to read this is you do not force another to take financial responsibility for you when you are able to work.

## Zakat

The Kitab-i-Aqdas enjoins upon us the payment of zakát for whatsoever is beneath the value of Huquq'u'llah.[^honoring-god-22] In 1873 when the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, the minimum was only going to be specified if God wills. A few times, Baha'u'llah tells the believers to follow the zakát teachings of the Qur'an.[^honoring-god-23]

[^honoring-god-22]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #146

[^honoring-god-23]: BH00069 and BH11399

> *“Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.”*[^honoring-god-24]

[^honoring-god-24]: Surah At-Tawbah (9:60)

The Qur'an does not specify an exact amount, but it states in multiple places to be regular in charity[^honoring-god-25], or who are active in deeds of charity.[^honoring-god-26] Zakát's purpose is very similar to the Rights of God, except there is no minimum threshold of wealth a person must achieve to pay. There is also no set amount to pay. The only command is regularity. How one conducts zakát is completely discretionary and it relies entirely on one's conscious and unique circumstances.

[^honoring-god-25]: Surah al-Muzzammil (73:20)

[^honoring-god-26]: Surah al-Mu'minun (23:4)

For example, in the days of Baha'u'llah a person could pay a slave's debt, or take another financial measure to free them. A person could offer a bed to someone travelling. A Trustee of alms could receive money for their role as a Trustee. There is no rigid practice. One may honor God as they please.

## The Bayanic Calendar {#sec-the-bayanic-calendar .unnumbered}

The Bayanic calendar was first introduced by the Bab in the Book of the Reckoning. In it, He creates a system of divine time with 19 months of 19 days. Each month is named after a name of God, and the days of the week are named after spiritual qualities. Below is a table describing the months:

| Month \# | Arabic Name | English Name | Elemental Phase | Thematic Phase | Spiritual Function |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| 1 | Bahá’ | Splendor | Fire | Glorification | The Point; essence of all months; attributed to “He Whom God Shall Make Manifest”; Naw-Rúz = Day of “There is no God but God” |

: Here are the days of the week[^honoring-god-27]:

[^honoring-god-27]: BH01964

| Arabic Name | English Meaning | Julian Counterpart |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|
|    Jalál    |      Glory      |      Saturday      |
|    Jamál    |     Beauty      |       Sunday       |
|    Kamál    |   Perfection    |       Monday       |
|    Fidál    |      Grace      |      Tuesday       |
|    ‘Idál    |     Justice     |     Wednesday      |
|  Istijlál   |     Majesty     |      Thursday      |
|  Istiqlál   |  Independence   |       Friday       |

Baha'u'llah uses this calendar in the Kitab-i-Aqdas to describe ways to honor God with regularity, based on the sacred pulse of the calendar. These acts are opportunities for all People of Baha to share experiences, memories, and develop stronger bonds of love, friendship, and kinship. The calendar also helps express the potential spiritual worlds we might pass through in greater cosmic order. The next sections will be chronological events and acts Baha'u'llah prescribes.

### 1 Baha - Naw-Ruz

The Bayanic calendar starts with the festival of Naw-Ruz.[^honoring-god-28] This holiday dates back to Zoroastrian times and has been a long-time cultural norm for Persia. The day has now been elevated as the first day in the sacred cycle of time. 1 Baha, when we overlap the names of the months for as the days, could be called the Baha of Baha, or the Splendor of All Splendor. Baha'u'llah says "in it the breath of life passes over all created things. Blessed is the one who encounters it with spirit and joy, for we bear witness that they are among the victorious."[^honoring-god-29] The Bab called it the Day of God.[^honoring-god-30]

[^honoring-god-28]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #16

[^honoring-god-29]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #111

[^honoring-god-30]: Persian Bayan Vahid 6, Gate 14

The day is astronomically defined by when the sun transitions from Pisces to Aries. This also correlates to the spring equinox, when there are 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night for every location in the world. Thus, it is also a day which honors the Oneness of God and the unity of humankind.

Naw-Ruz is a festival for those who observed the fast out of love for God.[^honoring-god-31] The festival begins at sunrise.[^honoring-god-32] Although Naw-Ruz originated in classical Persia, there are no rules specifying how the festival should be conducted. It could blend with any culture as long as the festival is observed in a way which abides by the Kitab-i-Aqdas. All that is required is spirit and joy.

[^honoring-god-31]: BH03908

[^honoring-god-32]: BH00215

### **Ridván:** **13 Jalál to 5 Jamál**

Ridvan is "the Most Great Festival, which is the king of festivals, being those days when the Ancient Beauty emerged from the Most Great House and illumined the Najibiyyih Garden with the light of His countenance. This is also called the Festival of Ridvan and the Festival of Roses, comprising twelve days from the Ancient Beauty’s first entry into that garden at the afternoon hour of the thirty-second day after Naw-Ruz, until His departure from the garden at noon of the forty-third day after Naw-Ruz. Work is forbidden on three days of this blessed festival: the first day, from afternoon to afternoon; the ninth day; and the final day. On the remaining days they may engage in their occupations."[^honoring-god-33]

[^honoring-god-33]: BH02278

The days where work is prohibited are 13 Jalál, 2 Jamál, and 5 Jamál.

Baha'u'llah manifested the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the 1st day of Ridván.[^honoring-god-34] It is a bounty so that you may associate with the followers of other religions and proclaim the Cause of your Lord. It is the crown of deeds. It is a period characterized by "boundless joy, gladness, and delight."[^honoring-god-35]

[^honoring-god-34]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #75

[^honoring-god-35]: BH00856

It appears this festival's focus would be to proclaim the Cause to the followers of other religions. Here are some possible ideas to observe Ridván. One would be to hold the festival in a public place which is not necessarily a Baha'i space. If it is a Baha'i space, there should be adequate space to welcome those who are not the People of Baha. There could be marketing materials welcoming the city or village to participate, particularly on the days all People of Baha are available to serve at the festival. A program could be Day 1, to celebrate the Announcement and who Baha'u'llah is. Day 9 could be to focus on sharing some of the new teachings and what makes the Revelation relevant and impactful. Day 12 could close with a shared spiritual practice of prayer, remembrance, and recitation, welcoming new believers and giving thanks to God for the bounty received. How would you and your community observe Ridván?

### Ayyam-i-Ha (Days of Giving)

Ayyam-i-Ha are the the intercalary days, which are not bound by the limits of the year and its months. Most years are 4 days of Ha, and on leap years, there are 5. They are considered the days of giving.[^honoring-god-36] The giving is for yourself, relatives, the poor, and the needy and the purpose of the giving is to exalt, magnify, and glorify the Lord with joy and gladness. There is deep spiritual meaning behind these days. Baha'u'llah says the Days of the Manifestation of Ha are eleven, with six being associated with creation. The remaining 5 are were revealed on the Night of Power through the letter "Ba." These days are like a day of sacrifice, where creation itself is completed.[^honoring-god-37]

[^honoring-god-36]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #16

[^honoring-god-37]: BH01228

I feel the placement of the Days of Ha after the month of Mulk is highly intentional given the purpose of the Bayanic calendar. Mulk means dominion and is to symbolize the period when we consolidate the spiritual elements within our earthly realm. These spiritual elements are a bounty, as much as what we earn through our occupations are also a bounty. If Mulk is for consolidation, the Days of Ha is for giving the excess with joy. This giving prepares us for the detachment from the earthly means we express through the fast immediately after the Days of Ha.

This would not have to be the only times to give the Rights of God and Zakat, but this could be great times to do so. Zakat does not have to be financial, and could be how we give a portion of our time in service to another. The community of the People of Baha, after accounting for what they have during Mulk, can assist those who struggled with a kind act. Maybe they consult on a plan to make the next year fruitful for those in need. It's a great time to take care of all the People of Baha as well as those who are not. Ayyam-i-Ha is not considered a festival by Baha'u'llah.

### The Fast

The fast is every year for the entire month of ‘Alá’.[^honoring-god-38] The People of Baha are to refrain from eating and drinking from sunrise until sunset. The fast is required for any person who has attained the age of maturity, as it was for the obligatory prayer. For those who are mature but are travelling, sick, pregnant, nursing, menstrating, or old, they are excused from fasting. This does not mean the exclusion from responsibility denies a person a right to blessings. Any person who is not required to fast may still fast if they choose to do so.

[^honoring-god-38]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #16

With the fast coming immediately after the Days of Ha and prior to Naw Ruz, it is the culmination of a year of spiritual attainment and practice. The fast is a cause of refinement and reformation of souls.[^honoring-god-39]

[^honoring-god-39]: BH08745

### Hospitality

Every Bayanic month, hospitality has been prescribed, even if it is only with water.[^honoring-god-40] The purpose is to bring hearts together. Baha'u'llah and the Sacred Household regularly provided hospitality to visitors and pilgrims when they were able to. Hospitality is the generous reception of guests, without expecting anything in return. This act of hospitality does not need to be a feast. This brings hearts together because it is an act of service.

[^honoring-god-40]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #57

This is my personal perspective: "My home is your home. In my home, I serve your needs. In my home, we are friends. In my home, we may serve the Cause of God. In my home, we are One."

## The Hijri Calendar

There are two other festivals to honor God which are based on the Hijri calendar, the calendar used by Muslims. In BH02278, written after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah clarifies the dates of the festivals without using the Bayanic calendar, despite its revelation. I believe the purpose is to tie in the significance of these dates prior to the existence of the Bayanic calendar, as a transition from the revelation of the Qur'an towards the fulfillment of the Qur'an.

### 5 Jamadiyu'l-Avval

This day in the Hijri year 1260, is when the Primal Point made His declaration to the Babu'l-Bab (Mulla Husayn). This correlates to the year May 23, 1844 in the Gregorian calendar. This night and day are of supreme greatness before God.

### 1 - 2 Muharram

The Primal Point was born on 1 Muharram 1235 and Baha'u'llah was born on 2 Muharram 1233. These two days are to be treated as one single festival. 1 Muharram is also the first day of the Hijri calendar. Muharram is considered in Islam to be a sacred month and is now associated with the birth of the most recent Dawnbreakers of Revelation, the Dawnbreakers who eventually made Naw Ruz the new 1st day of the Bayanic calendar.

## Emerging Virtues From Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness can be an innate value tied to the various practices of honoring God. This is because trust is the foundation of every sacred act. Without trust, no offering has weight, no word has substance, and no community can endure. Bahá’u’lláh calls trustworthiness “the greatest portal leading unto the tranquility and security of the people.” When we honor God, we are also showing that God can trust us—that we will protect what is sacred, give what is due, and carry the responsibilities of our lives with integrity. A trustworthy soul is one who remembers that every action echoes into the unseen, and that God’s love is never separate from His trust.

### **Justice**

Justice is not just a command, it is a quality of trustworthiness lived out in action. When we act justly, we honor God by aligning our decisions with divine equity rather than personal advantage. Justice means giving every soul their due, whether in material provision, opportunity, or recognition. It is not partial to friend or stranger. When Bahá’u’lláh tells us to be the essence of justice, He is asking us to hold ourselves accountable, to weigh our own selves before judging another, and to protect the rights of the poor and the oppressed. In this way, justice becomes a mirror of God’s own trust in us, that we will not misuse what we are given, nor withhold what we owe.

### **Mindfulness**

To be mindful is to live with attentive stewardship, to be aware not only of our actions, but of their spiritual implications. Honoring God through mindfulness means honoring the weight of every choice, word, and moment. Bahá’u’lláh speaks of those who “walk upon the earth with heedfulness,” and calls us to remember Him at all times. When we remember God in our work, in our hospitality, in our silence, we cultivate an inner state that is less reactive and more receptive. Mindfulness is trust in the present moment, a gentle form of reverence that listens before it speaks, and gives before it takes.

### **Patience**

Patience is trust stretched across time. It is the ability to wait without resentment, to labor without guarantee, and to suffer without complaint. When we are patient, we honor God’s wisdom in timing, and we yield our own urgency to His greater plan. Bahá’u’lláh teaches that “with every difficulty there is ease,” and that the days of sorrow are not permanent. Patience is not the absence of struggle, it is the posture of trust that transforms struggle into spiritual growth. It is a way of remembering that delay is not denial, and that God sees what we cannot.

### **Repentant**

To be repentant is not to be ashamed, it is to be courageous enough to return. Every soul falters, forgets, or falls short of trustworthiness at some point. But honoring God includes returning, again and again, to the seat of His mercy. Bahá’u’lláh’s writings are filled with calls to return. “Turn unto God and repent,” He says, “for His forgiveness is infinite.” Repentance is the act of cleansing the mirror. It is not about groveling, but about restoring clarity. In repenting, we affirm that God is still worthy of our honor, and that we still desire to be vessels of His trust.

### **Submissive**

Submission, in its truest form, is not self-erasure but an act of deep dignity. It means yielding to what is right, not because we are weak, but because we recognize a higher truth. Submissiveness to God is the soul’s way of accepting correction, embracing guidance, and releasing control. It allows us to be taught, even when we thought we knew. Bahá’u’lláh writes, “The source of true knowledge is submission unto God,” and in this light, submission becomes a virtue of strength. It is what lets us be molded by divine hands, rather than hardened by pride.

## Conclusion

This ends the portion of the book which discusses the spiritual practices of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Prayer, recitation, remembrance, reflection, and honoring God are each pathways for our liberation and pathways to develop and navigate our constellation of virtues. It is my hope you have been inspired to perform these spiritual practices and further your relationship with God. There is one more chapter to close Part 2.
