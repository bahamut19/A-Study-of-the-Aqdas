### 1 Baha - Naw-Ruz - Festival

The second festival is the day when We raised up the one who announced to the people this name by which the dead were raised to life, and all in the heavens and the earth, as well as those who came after, were gathered.

Blessed is the one who attains the first day of the month of Bahá, which God has made for this great Name. Blessed is the one who manifests God’s bounty upon themselves on this day, for they are among those who show gratitude to God through their actions, which demonstrate His favor that encompasses the worlds. Say: It is the foremost of months and its beginning, and in it the breath of life passes over all created things. Blessed is the one who encounters it with spirit and joy, for we bear witness that they are among the victorious.

## **Ridván:** **13 Jalál to 5 Jamál**

The Greatest Festival is the sovereign of all festivals. O people, remember God's bounty upon you, for when you were asleep, He awakened you with the breezes of revelation and made known to you His clear and straight path.

### Ridván (Day 1 - **13 Jalál)**

Baha'u'llah manifested the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the 1st day of Ridván.

It is a bounty so that you may associate with the followers of other religions and proclaim the Cause of your Lord. It is the crown of deeds.

## Who Is Required to Fast?

The age of maturity is the age when a believer is first required to fast, as well as other religious duties. In Questions and Answers, Baha'u'llah defines the age of maturity to be 15 years old for all people. This means anyone under 15 years old should not be expected, required, or forced to fast, even if you are the parent of a child under 15 years old.

Fasting is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to. A traveler also does not need to fast.

A woman who is menstrating does not have to fast or pray. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase "Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty" 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon. Additionally, if a woman is nurturing a baby, such as in pregnancy or nursing, does not need to fast.

## When?

The month of fasting is the month of 'Ala (Loftiness).

## How?

Refrain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset.

## Pilgrimage

Men are to perform pilgrimage to the Sacred House. The House is defined as the house where Baha'u'llah lived in Bahji, at Acre. The men are to be able-bodied and have the means to do so. If a man is not able to, it will not be held against him. Women are not required to, but are also allowed to if they so choose.

This difference in ruling is not about gender inequality, or saying women are less able to perform pilgrimage. This is about women having less of an obligation in God's eyes to perform a task. This is about mercy and generosity.

## Engaging in an Occupation

Engaging in an occupation is an act of worship. The purpose is to engage in activities that benefit yourself and others. This requires trusting in God, who is the provider.

Notice the purpose of the occupation is not necessarily to become wealthy, although wealth is one mode to benefit yourself and others. The goal is to find a way to benefit others and trust in God to provide.

## Rights of God (Ḥuqúqu’lláh)

If you possess 100 mithqáls (425g) of gold, nineteen mithqáls (80.75g) thereof belong to God.

Do not withhold yourselves from this great bounty.

Do not betray the Rights of God.

Do not deal with the Rights of God except with His permission.

Purpose is for the purification of wealth.

Purpose is drawing nearer to stations that none can attain except those whom God willed.

## Zakat

You have been enjoined to purify your sustenance and whatsoever is beneath it through the payment of zakát.

We shall specify for you its minimum amount if God so wills and desires.

### Verses from the Qur'an regardig Zakat

11. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:177)**\
    *“It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards the East or the West; but it is righteousness – to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practise regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing.”*

    *“He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord.”*

13. **Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267)**\
    *“O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise.”*

14. **Surah Al-Layl (92:18)**\
    *“Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification.”*

These verses highlight zakát as a central tenet in Islam, stressing charity, compassion, and the purification of wealth.

## Forbidden Religious Practices

Do not seclude yourself

Do not seek ascetic hardships

Do not deny yourself what God allows

Do not burden souls with what will make them lethargic and heavy; rather, give them what will lighten them, so they may soar with the wings of the verses to the dawn of clear evidences.

Do not ascend pulpits

## Clinging to Another Branch

Baha'u'llah tells the Emperor of Austria he was clinging to the branch, but was heedless of the root. Because of this, he did not recognize Baha'u'llah.

## Prior Revelation from God

Beware that you allow what has been revealed in the former Book from recognizing there is no God but God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.

No one should hold to anything today except that which has appeared in this Revelation. This is the command of God, before and after, and with it He has adorned the scriptures of former generations. This is the mention of God, before and after, with which He has embroidered the fabric of the Book of Existence, if you are of those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after. Beware lest you be of the abased. Nothing can avail you today, and no one has any refuge but God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whoever has known Me has known the intended purpose; whoever has turned to Me has turned to the Worshiped One. Thus has it been detailed in the Book, and the matter has been decreed by God, the Lord of the worlds.

Whoever reads a verse from My verses, it is better for him than reading the books of the former and latter generations.

This is the declaration of the Merciful, if you are of those who listen. Say: This is true knowledge, if you are of those who recognize.
