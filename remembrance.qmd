title: "Remembrance"
---

The next spiritual practice is Dhikr, or the remembrance of God. Before I go into the formal aspects of dhikr, I first want to reflect a little on what I experience when I remember anything.

Sometimes what I remember is a conscious choice I make. For example, when I want to think of an old memory or experience, whether the memory makes me happy or sad, I will spend a little time and energy seeing what I remember or how I remember it. This could be while I am alone going down memory lane, or it could be I am wanting to tell a story to a person next to me. I might be wanting to tell a story to entertain a group of people. I'm not a comedian but I might be on a stage hoping I am about to make the audience laugh. In these cases, the conscious memory can be expressed either silently or verbally, and if verbally, it could be done through speech or potentially through song. The purpose of remembering is really to feel the story behind the memory. What do I feel? Why do I feel it? How do I make others feel, either in the memory or to those about to witness my memory? Had the story changed since the last time I remembered?

There is also subconscious remembrance. Say I am going about my day and my senses are stimulated in a way which triggers a memory. Recent examples for me include a bluebird flying into a patch of grass and I remember a similar moment at my grandparent's yard, or I hear a voice with a certain accent and way of speaking and I remember a loved one whom I failed. These triggers come from sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. They are triggered within the mind and the heart, each activating the soul in peculiar ways.

Subconscious remembrance may also occur in a dream. The dream may take real objects, real people, and real sensations and combine them in unreal ways. While asleep you may feel a certain way and when you wake up, depending on what you remember, you may feel another. What did this mean? Did this dream serve a purpose?

These situations are ways to remember ourselves and anything associated with ourselves, but how might we remember God, who is Most Subtle? This chapter will describe formal and informal ways to remember God, it's purpose, and the emergent virtues remembrance develops.

## What Are We Remembering About God?

The Kitab-i-Aqdas does describe some memories we should use when remembering God. We are to remember God among His creation.[^remembrance-1] Creation, as we learned in Chapters 2 and 3, is everything within us and outside of us. Creation is seen and unseen. We are to remember God's bounty[^remembrance-2] provided to us through this Creation. Within this creation, we can remember God's mercy[^remembrance-3] and His greatness and power.[^remembrance-4] If creation seems scary or intimidating, we can always remember to seek refuge in God[^remembrance-5] such as with the prayer of the signs.

[^remembrance-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #117

[^remembrance-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #112

[^remembrance-3]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #14

[^remembrance-4]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #11

[^remembrance-5]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #167

We are to remember His mighty and wondrous Name.[^remembrance-6] This Name could refer to Baha'u'llah, which uses God's name of Glorious, or it could also refer to every name of God. We learned a lot of God's names in Chapter 1. We do not need to burden ourselves with remembering every name each time, but we should also be careful not to neglect any name over time. Nothing is excluded from the virtue moderation. When we remember Baha'u'llah, we remember He is not God, but the Manifestation of God and the dawning place of His most excellent names and the supreme Word (Revelation).[^remembrance-7]

[^remembrance-6]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #50

[^remembrance-7]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #143

Given we are to remember God, we are also to remember the Book (Kitab-i-Aqdas)[^remembrance-8] and what was revealed from Him,[^remembrance-9] which is the entirety of Baha'u'llah's Revelation.

[^remembrance-8]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #185

[^remembrance-9]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #172

## Subconscious Remembrance

> **O Essence of Heedlessness**\
> Alas, that a hundred thousand spiritual tongues are embodied in one speaking tongue, and a hundred thousand hidden meanings appear in one melody—yet there is no ear to hear, nor heart to grasp a single word.[^remembrance-10]

[^remembrance-10]: The Hidden Words in Persian #16

The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah embodies what subconscious remembrance looks like and its purpose. If there are a hundred thousand spiritual tongues, perhaps from those infinite spiritual worlds we have opportunities to pass through, there could also be a hundred thousand spiritual ears for every ear, or a hundred thousand spiritual hearts for every heart which grasps a single word. The Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #185 offers a simple blueprint for subconscious remembrance. Baha'u'llah says "This is the counsel of God, if you are among those who hear. This is the grace of God, if you are among those who turn toward Him. This is the remembrance of God, if you are among those who feel. This is the treasure of God, if you are among those who know."

Subconscious remembrance is not actively remembering, but allowing memories and reminders enter our being. When Baha'u'llah mentions our hearing, He wants us to be able to hear God. This could be through sounds such as when we hear the recitation of His verses, or the sounds of birds when we spend time being quiet outdoors. It could also be those mysterious voices in our head, or the silent vibrations, audible or inaudible, which pass into us or through us. Hearing is also a pathway to immediate action. When you hear a siren, you are immediately alarmed and determine what the best response is to the emergency or first respondents to the emergency. Hearing the counsel of God helps compel the counsel of God to be enacted.

When Baha'u'llah mentions knowing, this includes all pathways to knowledge. While hearing can be a pathway to knowledge, so can reading and experiencing. All of our faculties connect to our mind, which is capable of processing every stimulus instantaneously. Perhaps when we look somewhere, there is an expression of a name or attribute of God waiting to be observed. Maybe we have a theory about how something works, and we test it. Do we test it with internal bias, ensuring the data fits our assumptions, or do we have an open mind and all the data to guide our knowing? If we allow our minds to know openly, we can allow our minds to know honestly. God, in all honesty, tells us knowing is the treasure of God. If a treasure, once hidden is discovered, it has transformative effects.

When Baha'u'llah mentions feeling, this is an appeal for the heart. He says hearts are capable of enlightenment.[^remembrance-11] Sometimes we avoid what we feel, so as to minimize our pain or to reduce the potential for suffering. There are those who will use drugs for the purpose of enhancing certain feelings they are unable to feel on their own, while hoping to hide the feelings they no longer want. It seems everything makes us feel something. What if what we are scared of feeling is the pathway to enlightenment? It could at least be a pathway of empathy.

[^remembrance-11]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #31

With our senses, mind, and heart in subconscious remembrance, being receptive to whatever God has to offer us, we can turn towards Him with our souls. Remembrance cannot fully practiced without the mirror of our soul facing the Sun of Divinity. We may not always be fully turned towards God in our every day actions and lives, but the story which God desires to tell us through these memories can never be complete without the soul's orientation being whatever God wills. We don't do this by telling others "I am a Mirror" but by being a mirror.

## Conscious Remembrance

I want to open with this portion from the Persian Bayan by the Bab:

> The remembrance you practice now is by virtue of the command of the Point of the Bayán, but that appearance is the essential reality of the Point of the Bayán in its latter stage, which is infinitely more powerful than its first appearance. If you mention Him secretly and believe in Him, your secret remembrance is multiplied by ninety-five times more reward than open remembrance. Yet on the Day of His appearance, call upon the Truth openly, for on that day, open remembrance surpasses ninety-five instances of hidden remembrance. This is the very essence of remembrance in the presence of the one who remembers and the One remembered, should you be able to comprehend it. “Therefore let them remember God in secret,” while they remain empowered in that state, and be watchful over the attachments of your heart, for its degrees are without limit.
>
> If you are among those who are vigilant, you will recognize that in the intensity of secret remembrance, its ruling can match that of the open, until in both sleep and wakefulness the remembrance in the heart takes on a single form. But even if you reach that level, should you fail to recognize the Sun of Reality, it will not benefit you; if you do reach it, absent that Sun, it may still benefit you. Multiplying your remembrance is not what is beloved, whether in secret or openly. Rather, if you offer one remembrance with spirit and fragrance, it is better than a thousand devoid of spirit and fragrance. Each person knows within themselves the measure of sincere remembrance.[^remembrance-12]

[^remembrance-12]: The Persian Bayan, Vahid 9 Gate 4

Conscious remembrance would be the intentional acts of remembrance we practice. The Kitab-i-Aqdas provides direct guidelines in how this remembrance should be conducted, and much of it can be conducted in either secret or in the open. Much like how Baha'u'llah did not want a person to be burdened by tiresome recitation, the Bab expressed how remembrance should be done with spirit and fragrance. Baha'u'llah also says to exalt, magnify, and glorify their Lord with joy and gladness.[^remembrance-13] We should thank Him with joy and spiritual fragrance.[^remembrance-14]

[^remembrance-13]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #16

[^remembrance-14]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #74

The purpose of conscious remembrance is not to do it merely to do it. As we are to use our senses to receive from God, we are to use ourselves to give to God and those near to us. We use our voices for others to hear, we use our minds so others can know, we use our hearts so others can feel, and we use our souls so others can turn towards Him. To do so, you have to actually feel the spirit and fragrance. It has to come from deep within you, these feelings of joy and gladness.

We are also to rejoice in the joy of the Greatest Name (Baha'u'llah), by which hearts are enraptured and the minds of the near ones are attracted.[^remembrance-15] This is not worship of Baha'u'llah, but it is rejoicing this name exists, it has manifested in the form of the temple of Baha'u'llah, and is something to be thankful to God. Baha'u'llah is the point of adoration (Qiblih).

[^remembrance-15]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #51

One way we can conduct remembrance is through music. Music is a ladder for the ascent of souls to the highest horizon.[^remembrance-16] Baha'u'llah does give us a warning. He says "do not make it the wings of self and desire" and to "beware your listening does not lead you away from the path of dignity and reverence." Ladders can be used to go up or down, and we definitely want our souls to ascend in its path to liberation.

[^remembrance-16]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #51

Baha'u'llah also says "do not conduct remembrance in the streets or marketplaces. Do so in a place designated for remembrance or in your home. This is closer to sincerity and piety."[^remembrance-17] If we do want to remember God in the streets and marketplaces, this would be one of those times to practice secret remembrance. Secret remembrance could be done silently or in a whisper. For some reason I imagine a musical number from Mary Poppins where random people join me for a choreographed dance and singing, but it's really only in my head. Remembrance of God can also joyously occur with spiritual fragrance even in silence.

[^remembrance-17]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #108

True remembrance is designed so we can truly feel the spirit and share the spirit. In the prior excerpt from the Bayan, we learned remembrance has no value if it keeps us from recognizing God and His Manifestations, whereupon denying a Manifestation is equating to denying God. Baha'u'llah continues this warning, telling us "beware...that remembrance veils you from this Most Mighty Remembrance." This warning is incredibly important. What if we do remembrance contrary to what God desires and we end up not recognizing the future Manifestation of God, cause future generations from recognizing the future Manifestation of God, or do so in a way which prevents people of today from recognizing Baha'u'llah as the Manifestation of God. Say for example, we express the remembrance of God's name All-Merciful and we respond to a person with apathy, indifference, or cruelty? Is this response in remembrance? Will a person come to love God or love Baha'u'llah in such a situation?

## The Recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá

"Each day, the recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá (God is Most Glorious) is to be done 95 times while facing the Qiblih. Ablutions need to be done prior.[^remembrance-18] This is a daily practice of remembrance which helps teach us one way to remember a Name of God. This recitation can be done in secret or in the open, depending on where you are. You can perform this all at once or spread it out during the day. However, if you spread it out, ablutions would need to be performed each time. You can use prayer beads or other tool to keep count, but do be mindful of the fact you are not remembering the count. You are remembering God.

[^remembrance-18]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #18

This practice is derived from the Persian Bayan in Vahid 5, Gate 17. "In this gate, it is decreed that from sunrise to sunset, every soul is permitted to recite ninety-five times phrases such as *“God is Most Glorious” (Alláh-u-Abhá),* *“God is Most Great” (Alláh-u-A‘ẓam),* *“God is Most Manifest” (Alláh-u-Aẓhar),* *“God is Most Radiant” (Alláh-u-Anwar),* *“God is Most Exalted” (Alláh-u-Akbar),* or similar exalted expressions." There would be nothing wrong in adding any of these statements of praise to your remembrance, as long as you are still capable of doing so with spirit, joy, and fragrance. I could envision a worship service of the People of Baha where nothing is happening but using music to collectively sing these names and praises of God. Wouldn't that truly be glorious?

## Emergent Virtues From Courtesy

Courtesy is the innate virtue that allows remembrance to take root in action. While remembrance turns the heart toward God, courtesy turns that heart toward others with grace and awareness. As we remember God, we become more sensitive to how our presence, words, and behavior reflect what we carry inside. Courtesy is the outer shell, but these six emergent virtues are its living qualities. Each one refines our remembrance into a social, spiritual, and interpersonal offering—how we show that we have remembered well.

### Dignity

> The foundation of dignity is for the servant to be content with what has been bestowed upon him and to be satisfied with what has been decreed for him.[^remembrance-19]

[^remembrance-19]: Asl-i-Kullu’l-Khayr (Essence of All Good)

Remembrance nurtures dignity by anchoring the soul in divine will. When we remember God's providence and perfection, we cease striving to elevate ourselves through comparison, complaint, or vanity. Dignity blossoms as a form of quiet acceptance—a noble posture rooted not in status, but in contentment. Through remembrance, we realize our worth is not in the eyes of others but in being known and seen by God. Dignity, as a fruit of courtesy, teaches us to stand before both friend and foe with the same measured self-respect, because the soul that remembers God knows that He alone determines value.

### Fairness

> When the sun of wisdom rose from the horizon of the heavens of governance, it spoke with this sublime word: The people of wealth, and the possessors of honor and power, should regard the sanctity of religion with the best creativity possible. Religion is a clear light and a strong fortress for the protection and comfort of the people of the world. It commands righteousness through the fear of God and forbids wrongdoing. If the lamp of religion remains hidden, chaos and disorder will find their way, and the lights of justice and fairness, and the sun of security and tranquility, will be obscured from their radiance.[^remembrance-20]

[^remembrance-20]: Lawh-i-Ishráqát (Tablet of Splendors)

Remembrance restores fairness by keeping the inner lamp of divine guidance lit. When God’s names—Just, All-Seeing, All-Wise—are on our tongue and in our heart, we measure our judgments against something greater than impulse or self-interest. Fairness emerges from courtesy when our dealings are governed by principle, not preference. Remembrance reminds us that justice is not just a system but a state of being; it is a form of spiritual clarity that preserves order and shields the weak. In remembering God, we recall that every soul has a station, and fairness is the way we honor it.

### Kindness

> We have commanded all to the greatest love. Blessed is the one who perceives the fragrance of My utterance and observes what has been revealed in My clear Book. All should conduct themselves with utmost kindness and compassion toward the servants of God.[^remembrance-21]

[^remembrance-21]: BH00469

Kindness flows from remembrance as the fragrance of divine mercy. In remembering the Loving, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, our own conduct softens. Courtesy is given emotional warmth through kindness; it moves beyond politeness into heartfelt concern. Kindness is the echo of God's remembrance within us, extended to others not because they earned it, but because we have remembered who they are in God’s sight. Each act of sincere remembrance deepens our reservoir of compassion, making kindness not just a virtue, but a reflex of the soul.

### Purity

> Understanding divine words and grasping the messages from spiritual sources does not rely on external, worldly knowledge. Rather, it depends on the purity of the heart, the purification of the soul, and the freedom of the spirit. There are indeed some devout individuals who have never engaged in formal learning yet sit on the wings of knowledge, their hearts adorned with the flowers of wisdom and tulips of understanding, fed by the clouds of divine grace.[^remembrance-22]

[^remembrance-22]: Kitab-i-Iqan

Remembrance cleanses the soul, preparing it for purity. When we speak God's names or dwell upon His attributes, we are not merely repeating phrases—we are washing the inner self of ego, distraction, and worldly attachment. Courtesy without purity can become performance, but when remembrance purifies intention, even simple actions gain spiritual depth. The more our remembrance is sincere, the more our hearts are cleared of noise, making room for subtle inspiration. Purity, then, is the refinement of remembrance—it emerges not in separation from the world, but in our ability to live in it with a heart undisturbed.

### Radiance

> O Child of My Maidservant! If you seek the grace of the Holy Spirit, consort with the free. For the righteous have drunk the eternal cup from the hand of the celestial cupbearer and bring life, radiance, and light to the dead hearts of others, as the true dawn.[^remembrance-23]

[^remembrance-23]: The Hidden Words in Persian #58

Remembrance fills the soul with light, and this light is what gives birth to radiance. When the soul remembers God with joy and fragrance, it begins to glow with spiritual vitality. Radiance is courtesy that shines—it warms conversations, softens conflicts, and uplifts gatherings. It is not boastful exuberance, but the presence of divine remembrance made visible. Radiant souls don’t try to impress; they express something beyond themselves. Through consistent remembrance, one becomes like a lamp in the window of God’s house, seen from afar, and comforting up close.

### Refinement

> He desires to see you adorned with the manners of the people of Paradise in His supreme, invincible dominion. Uphold refinement in all matters so that eyes do not fall upon what is displeasing to your souls and to the inhabitants of Paradise.[^remembrance-24]

[^remembrance-24]: Kitab-i-Aqdas Verse #46

Refinement is the art of making remembrance visible through beauty and care. It is courtesy matured and sculpted by remembrance. When we remember God, we begin to pay attention not only to what we say, but how we say it; not only to what we do, but how we do it. Refinement is not luxury, but precision and grace in conduct. It is how remembrance elevates the mundane into the sacred. The more we remember the Sublime and the Most Exalted, the more we try to reflect that glory in our actions, our speech, our presentation—even in silence.

## In Closing

I want to close this chapter with a prophetic warning Baha'u'llah sent to Napoleon III and his fake claim of remembrance and how it violated the innate virtues of courtesy by betraying the people of Europe:

> O King, We heard a word from you when the King of Russia asked you about the judgment of war. Your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. You said, I was asleep in the cradle, the call of the oppressed woke me until they were drowned in the Black Sea. Thus We heard, and your Lord is a witness to what I say. We testify that it was not the call that woke you but desire, for We tested you and found you secluded. Recognize the tone of speech and be of the discerning.
>
> We do not wish to return to you a bad word to preserve the station We granted you in the visible life. We chose courtesy and made it a habit of the close ones. It is a garment that suits every soul, young and old. Blessed is the one who made it the adornment of his body, and woe to the one who is deprived of this great favor. If you were the possessor of the word, you would not have cast the Book of God behind your back when it was sent to you from the Mighty, the Wise. We tested you with it, and We did not find you as you claimed. Arise and make up for what you missed. The world will perish and what you have, and the dominion will remain for God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. You should not limit matters to what your desire wants. Beware the sighs of the oppressed, protect him from the arrows of the oppressors. What you did will cause matters to differ in your kingdom, and the dominion will leave your hand as a result of your actions. Then you will find yourself in manifest loss, and earthquakes will seize all tribes there unless you arise to support this cause and follow the Spirit in this straight path.[^remembrance-25]

[^remembrance-25]: Suriy-i-Haykal (Surah of the Temple)

True remembrance is not proclaimed but it is proven. May our remembrance never be a veil, but a mirror turned toward the Sun, that all who see us may remember Him.
