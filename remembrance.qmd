## The Recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá

Each day, the recitation of Alláh-u-Abhá (God is Most Glorious) is to be done 95 times while facing the Qiblih. Ablutions need to be done prior.

### **Gate 17 (Recite the Sacred Names 95 Times Each Day)**

The Seventeenth Gate of the Fifth Unity, concerning the obligation of remembrance in each month, that God should be mentioned ninety-five times each day:

In this gate, it is decreed that from sunrise to sunset, every soul is permitted to recite ninety-five times phrases such as *“God is Most Glorious” (Alláh-u-Abhá),* *“God is Most Great” (Alláh-u-A‘ẓam),* *“God is Most Manifest” (Alláh-u-Aẓhar),* *“God is Most Radiant” (Alláh-u-Anwar),* *“God is Most Exalted” (Alláh-u-Akbar),* or similar exalted expressions.

## Remembering

## Hearing (Action)

This is the counsel of God, if you are among those who hear.

## Turn Towards Him (Soul)

This is the grace of God, if you are among those who turn toward Him

## Feel (Heart)

This is the remembrance of God, if you are among those who feel.

## Know (Mind)

This is the treasure of God, if you are among those who know.

## Remembrance

Of God

Of Baha'u'llah

Exalt the Lord with joy and gladness

Magnify the Lord with Joy and gladness

Glorify the Lord with Joy and gladness

Rejoice in the joy of the Greatest Name, by which hearts are enraptured and the minds of the near ones are attracted.

Thank Him with joy and spiritual fragrance

Music is a ladder for the ascent of souls to the highest horizon

Do not conduct remembrance in the streets or marketplaces. Do so in a place designated for remembrance or in your home. This is closer to sincerity and piety.

### Beware That Remembrance Becomes a Veil
