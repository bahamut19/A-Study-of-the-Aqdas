## Build Up the Cities

Build up the cities and lands of God, and then remember Him within them with the melodies of those who are near to Him. Hearts are, indeed, cultivated by the tongue, just as homes and cities are built by the hand and by other means. We have appointed a cause for everything from Our presence; hold fast to it and trust in the All-Wise, the All-Knowing.
