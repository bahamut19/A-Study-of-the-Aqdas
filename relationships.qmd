**Focus:** Rights and responsibilities before and during courtship

-   

-   Right to emotional and sexual boundaries

-   

-   Consent and mutuality as sacred

-   

-   Seeking tranquility and compatibility

-   

-   Prohibition of coercion or manipulation

-   

-   Limitations on secrecy and deceit

-   

-   Place for chaste intimacy and honesty

-   

This could integrate the idea that **relationships are a reflection of oneâ€™s relationship with God**, building toward marriage.
