Eyes will not fall upon what is displeasing to souls.

## Reverence

## Detachment

Abandon what you possess and soar with the wings of detachment above the realm of creation.

Abandon the world, turning your heart towards the Beloved. The vibration of the Word would seize you in such a manner that the greater world would tremble, let alone the lesser world.

## Be Thankful

Through it, your stations will be revealed, your names will be established, and your ranks and remembrances will be elevated in a well-guarded Tablet. Beware that nothing on earth prevents you from attaining this exalted, noble station.

## Reason

A lack of reason causes people to seek what harms them and abandon what benefits them. They are wanderers.
