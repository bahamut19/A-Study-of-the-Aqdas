[^appendix-7-1]: The Spanish political situation was highly unstable in 1873. King Amadeo I abdicated in February, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. Therefore, Spain's head of state in the latter half of 1873 (ruling Cuba and Puerto Rico) was the President of the Executive Power, Emilio Castelar (who was serving at the end of the year).

[^appendix-7-2]: France was under the Third Republic in 1873. It was not ruled by a monarch, but by a President, Patrice de MacMahon, who governed the French colonies in the Americas (e.g., French Guiana, Martinique).
