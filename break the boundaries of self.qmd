## Turn Towards God

## Fear God

## All are Servants and Signs

## Brought to Life with a Spirit from Him

## Be Prayerful in the Morning

Do not let the splendors of God's majesty prevent you from having a relationship with God each day. Take cup of prosperity in the morning and drink with the remembrance of His mighty and wondrous Name, Baha.

## Abandon Illusions
