    "text": "What could a community be like if the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha’u’llah is the primary source of guidance? As of this writing, there have been no distinct communities which emphasize the fullness of the Aqdas. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is addressed to all of creation and for the people of Baha.\nMy goal is to take a loving look in the Aqdas, use Baha’u’llah’s teachings to explain and expand upon concepts, and to use whatever inspiration I have access to at least demonstrate the potentials the Aqdas has for you, for me, and for the rest of us who believe in Baha’u’llah.\nThis book is merely my own personal understanding and perspective, just one way to look at it. Perhaps you may also have your own way as well. I welcome any discussion of this book, the Aqdas, and the building of distanct Aqdas communities. Thank you!",

    "text": "2.1 The Lord of all Religions\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas’s first five verses set the table for the foundation of faith. The first foundation is a belief in God, who is the Lord of all Religions.\nThe first question a person could have would be what qualifies as a religion? So far in the writings of Baha’u’llah, there is nothing in particular which qualifies what makes a religion true or false. There are exhortations saying some scriptures are true, but Baha’u’llah does not say other religions who do not have a scripture are not true. Scriptures does not equal religion as many religions exist without formal scripture.\nBaha’u’llah does refer to the practices of various faiths in the surrounding areas, such as ascetic practices of Hinduism.\nReligion is any faith-based practice which has some kind of ritual, tradition, mode of worship, and a belief in at least one diety. The word “all” is the most inclusive word one can use. If a person were to ask “Is God the Lord of so-and-so religion?” the answer should always be “yes.”\nThe Kitab-i-Ahd reminds the people to always remember “All is from God.” This phrase is the very foundation of belief. All is from God. It is also the foundation of unity. With God being One, All is also One, even when there are differing attributes and qualities being expressed and observed. Even in polytheistic traditions, all is from God. If a religion has a practice which is different from another religion, all is from God.",

In Questions and Answers, Baha’u’llah defines the age of maturity to be 15 years old for all people. This means anyone under 15 years old should not be expected, required, or forced to pray, even if you are the parent of a child under 15 years old.\nPrayer is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to.\nA woman who is menstrating does not have to perform obligatory prayer nor fast. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase “Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty” 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon.\nThe prayers, whether obligatory or not, are to be done on an individual basis and in private. The emphasis is the individual’s relationship with God and their individual spiritual journey. The exception to this is the Prayer for the Dead. All of these can be done in your native language, or any language you know where you understand what is being said.",

A rak’ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha’u’llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.",

    "text": "6.4 Time of Day\nThe obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThe small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.\nFor believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable. For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.\nDepending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha’u’llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.\nAs God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.\nNo matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.",

As the point is currently the point where the Sun of Truth and Explanation had set, this would be the mansion of Bahji in present day Acre, Israel.\nAs a simple sidenote, Acre is one of the world’s longest continuously lived settlements, going back to the Bronze Age. It also served as the final stronghold for Christian Crusaders before they were defeated by the Mamluks. Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.\nToday, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don’t have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect. For prayers which are not obligatory, a believer can face in any direction. God is in all directions.",

There is a version for the male deceased and another for the female deceased. The second option exists if the believer has not remembered the full prayer. This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.\nThe Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.",

    "text": "6.8 No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing\nA person can wear their hair as they wish. Baha’u’llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha’u’llah states these rules were not in the Qur’an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish.\nI believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha’u’llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.\nA female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.",

You could be on the finest marble and it is acceptable if it is clean. Once again, the idea is for prayer to be accessible and focused on the spirit, not the material.",

Baha’u’llah has abrogated this and says we only need to say, ““Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.”\nThe verse is a great reminder in times of fear and distress. Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.",

The first option is to do a single prostration on a clean surface and recite “Glory be to God, the Lord of Grandeur and Majesty, of Bounty and Grace.” If one is unable to find a clean surface or is unable to prostrate for any reason, the second option is to say “Glory be to God.”\nAfter the prostration, sit in the position of unity. I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say “Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty” 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.\nIt should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer. This can, at a minimum, take just a minute although the length can vary depending on how you recite the prayer.",

This means anyone under 15 years old should not be expected, required, or forced to fast, even if you are the parent of a child under 15 years old.\nFasting is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to. A traveler also does not need to fast.\nA woman who is menstrating does not have to fast or pray. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase “Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty” 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon.

The impact of any loss of life by another person is too great. It weakens the fabric of the community, causes trauma, distrust, and potentially thoughts and feelings which can betray which God desires for us.\nIn another sense, it is an act of shirk, the Arabic concept of joining partners with God.

    "text": "12.4 Sexual Acts\n\n12.4.1 Adultery\nAdultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.\nThere are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.",

    "text": "12.5 Social Acts\n\n12.5.1 Backbiting\nBackbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.\nAdditionally, Baha’u’llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say “I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?” The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.\nThe backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.\nNow, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.\nFinally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha’u’llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?\n\n\n12.5.2 Slander\nSlander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another’s reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.",

No matter the amount of inheritance provided, any person who receives some should be grateful for the bounty provided. There are no exceptions based upon judgments of character or other qualifications to receive. This ensures there is no vying for an increased portion, or any attempts to deny another their portion. This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.\nThere is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha’u’llah’s command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved’s life is beneficial for the community.",
