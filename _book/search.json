    "text": "Praise be to God, the Creator of and Source of all inspiration, knowledge, and wisdom!\nAllah’u’abha!\nThe Bab and Baha’u’llah, from 1844 to 1892, ushered in a new era for all mankind. The culmination of their revelations, the Bayan by the Bab in 1848, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha’u’llah in 1873, offer the framework to develop individuals, communities, and nations in a newly spiritual way. The Bayan, which was unfinished prior to the Bab’s execution in 1850, was symbolically completed by the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Up until this point in 2025, there have been no English language studies of the entire Kitab-i-Aqdas. This is partially because many followers of Baha’u’llah merely view the book as only a book of laws, partially because it was not translated until over a 100 years after its completion, and partially because other authors are more preeminent among communities which believe in Baha’u’llah.\nThis book aims to place the Kitab-i-Aqdas in the exalted position it deserves to be. To do this, we need to understand the Kitab-i-Aqdas is more than a book of laws, it is the framework for God’s will, which is to guide people towards salvation, to create distinct spiritual communities, and to bring about unity among the people of the world. The Bayan will be used as a primary supplement, as well as other writings by Baha’u’llah. No other sources will be considered. It is a technique which is rarely used, to use Scripture to explain Scripture.\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas makes no claim of starting completely from scratch, to not have any prior origins or inspirations. It also does not deny the reality of the ways of the world in which it was created. The world was already deep into the Industrial Revolution and on the cusp of the Modern age. Some societies were progressing in certain qualities more than others, which brought with each certain strengths and certain weaknesses. What the Kitab-i-Aqdas does is act like a composer of music, taking instruments which already exist, notes and chords which already exist, and using them to create an entirely new composition. This composition is entirely unique in itself, but shouldn’t be terribly strange to anyone. When listened to in its entirety, you will feel its vibrations within your soul, a soul which does yearn to have a relationship with the divine. This composition is itself a new technique able to create more heavenly compositions, where the compositions are the various organizations of society. This has its place to refine what already exists so that mankind can be prepared, guided, and inspired to continue its progress into perpetual tomorrow, a tomorrow of hope, love, and if so desired, peace.\nI make no claim of expertise, divinity, or scholarly prowess. I do not claim where the contents of this book is the only way to interpret the Kitab-i-Aqdas. My perspective is but one perspective and my hope is more authors offer their own perspectives on this magnificent work. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is worthy of scholarship and a place on every bookshelf, coffeetable, and handbag.\nThis book will be divided into six parts. The first part will be the pillars of belief and will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. The second part will focus on the relationship we are capable of having with God. After this, we will cover the life of the individual, which will build off the first two parts. The life of the individual will focus a more legalistic approach that will guide a person’s everyday actions and attitude. The fourth part will expand the life of the individual to community and family life. The fifth part will focus the prior two parts towards those who lead, who bear more responsibility than those who do not. The final part will discuss the Houses of Justice, whose purpose requires all the lessons learned from the prior five parts.\nI am grateful you have given this book a chance to be read. Thank you!",

    "text": "1.1 Chapter Introduction\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas never explicitly says it is required to believe in God, but the mention of God is everywhere within it. The belief in God is foundational to everything else within the Kitab-i-Aqdas. The book is rarely considered a mystical treatise nor is rarely recommended to read to learn how to grow your spirit. In reality, the Kitab-i-Aqdas’s entire purpose is the growth of the human spirit through a constant interweaving of mystic teachings, theology, and straightforward commands.\nOne way Baha’u’llah enables this journey is by ensuring God is part of every single command and teaching. He does this by calling on God’s various names and attributes. I counted 110 different names used for God within the Kitab-i-Aqdas. This is not every name of God and of course all of names can exist within every language. Both the Bab and Baha’u’llah would teach God is inclusive of all names and is the source of all names.1 Instead of studying all 100 different names, the next section will focus on a grouping these names and attributes into 19 groups. I chose 19 due to the significance of the number in representing unity. These 19 groups will start with one concept and use this concept to progress to the next concept. Each group name will also have a number showing how often the names in the group appear in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.",

    "text": "1.2 19 Groups of Names and Attributes\n\n1.2.1 Subtlety (2)\nSubtlety is the quality of being difficult to analyze or even detect. When combined with the name Inaccessible, we can start to imagine God’s mysterious and hidden nature. God may seem unable to be directly observed, or to some, lacking in direct evidence or proof. Yet, these qualities are highly nuanced. Subtlety can be viewed as an interweaving of words, meanings, ideas, and feelings which language may not be able to fully convey, or the conveyance can be completely relative to the contexts of time, space, and perspective. In one moment you may have an understanding and in the next, you gain a different understanding.\nThere are hundreds of traditions which attempt to explain who God is through art, music, dance, and poetic stories. They are filled with metaphor, exaggerated expressions, and other methods in an attempt to express the mystery which is God. Each are expressions of the subtlety of God, when all taken together are a divine tapestry whose threads are interwoven in truth and a shared experience along a spiritual journey. This also means there is more than one way to experience God. The Kitab-i-Aqdas provides the framework to open up these experiences, to find the different pathways to explore the hidden nature of God. All one must do is seek, to be a seeker.\nThe next 18 groups include the quality of Subtlety.\n\n\n1.2.2 Manifestation (2)\nOne way God assists the seeker is by manifesting signs that hint at His presence. The purpose is to make the inaccessible more accessible, even if it isn’t accessibility in God’s entirety. These signs might not be obvious like a stop sign, but could be more like being nearsighted as you approach a highway sign pointing to multiple paths. It may be something not immediately clear, or if you are looking in a different direction, the sign is something you may not observe. Signs are full of subtlety.\nThese signs could come from the natural world and the laws of creation in which we are a part of. They could come from others like ourselves through their actions, thoughts, and feelings. They could even come from our own imagination or subconscious, such as with a dream. A seeker may not observe every sign and when a sign is observed, may not understand the significance of the sign completely. A person who is not seeking may not even be aware there are signs. Yet, they are there for everyone with great consistency.\nGod can be made Manifest in different forms to include through humanity. A human Manifestation of God is a reflection and embodiment of God Himself. This will go into deeper detail regarding Manifestations of God in the chapter “Belief in the Manifestation of God.”\nThe next 17 groups include the quality of Manifestation.\n\n\n1.2.3 Knowledge (46)\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas uses the names such as All-Knowing, All-Informed, Wise, and the Knower of All Things frequently. These words conveys God’s own infinite knowledge, a knowledge when Manifested is all full of Subtlety. Sometimes the knowledge may seem inaccessible or difficult to understand. This is an acceptable perspective. Sometimes knowledge is entirely based on perspective, especially within space and time. What a person knows in one moment as true can change as facts change, conditions change, or new knowledge becomes known. What is true within the Kitab-i-Aqdas is God possesses all knowledge.\nSometimes this knowledge is viewed as a knowledge of all facts. This could be knowledge of what is within our hearts. It could be knowledge of all possible outcomes. This could be a knowledge of all which has been manifested. This could be a knowledge of all which could be manifested. This knowledge is derived from the Manifestations of the Signs.\nAs names such as All-Knowing exist with Subtlety, these infinite modes of potential clarity and understanding are interwoven within each other, completely nuanced, and are all pathways to the name Manifest. This knowledge leads to God being the Wise, knowing how to apply knowledge in the best way possible.\nThe next 16 groups include the quality of Knowledge.\n\n\n1.2.4 Creation (6)\nGod’s names include the Dawning Place of Signs and the Creator of the Earth and Heavens. Creation is manifested through God’s Knowledge. God’s role as Creator begins to become evident, showing how His knowledge shapes and sustains the universe. “Every beginning is from God and unto Him it returns. He is indeed the source of creation and the ultimate destination of all the worlds.”2\nWith God being the creator, is also demonstrates God’s eternal preexistence. God is the Creator, not the created. God is the Cause and Creation is the Effect. Through Knowledge, God is able to express His purpose, and through Creation He is able to fulfill this purpose. As God is the Creator of the Earth and Heavens, He is the Creator of all we are able to observe and all which we are unable to observe. God is the Creator of the Seen and the Unseen. God is the creator of all we feel and experience. God is the creator of all purpose, of all action, of all energy, and of all matter. God is the creator of you and I, and all which we care about.\nCreation demonstrates Subtlety in that even seemingly simple things, such as a human cell, are complex and quite mysterious. The How and the Why a cell originates and functions demonstrate the subtle craftmanship of a Creator, whereupon so far the answers to why remain quite inaccessible. All of Creation maintains this Subtlety.\nThe next 15 groups include the quality of creation.\n\n\n1.2.5 Power (36)\nThe Power group includes the second most frequency of names in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. These names include the Almighty, All-Powerful, All-Capable, All-Subduing, and All-Sufficient. Each of these names express a different mode or aspect of God as Power. With God being the Creator, an awareness of God’s Power and omnipotence follows.\nMight can be synonymous with strength, especially with the traditional notions of being able to exert a great amount of force. Power can be viewed in how strength can be projected, or the ability to exert influence. Being capable is the ability to get things done, especially through skill. Subduing is being able to express one’s Will over another. Being All-Sufficient means being qualified and competent in using power to achieve the required goals and to fulfill purpose.\nThese names all demonstrate God’s ability to govern and sustain all which has been created. Notice how Power comes after other attributes such as being All-Knowing. Knowledge leads to Power. Power itself does not lead to being All-Knowing. This shows, in a way, how being Almighty or All-Subduing can be quite nuanced by Subtlety. Skill in using might and power involves knowing what tools to use, or exactly the right amount of energy to achieve the purpose within creation. The use of power might be a challenge to understand, as is understanding God’s Will, which is a Will that subdues all of creation. The Will of God could be quite difficult to comprehend or fathom, also being a part of the greater mystery of God. There is hidden strength, such as how fine-tuned the laws of physics are or how life seemingly came from inert matter. Power does not need to be coercive but instead influential, such as in the role to guide hearts or establish those natural laws. The rotation of the planets or the growth of a seed show how God can invisibly utilize power. There doesn’t need to be extravagant, one-time shows of might for power to be manifested. Because God manifests the Signs, power does not need to be a show of domination, but a gentle way to empower creation to flourish. Dramatic interventions are always possible with God if it serves a purpose, and whether they are dramatic or subtle, the power is always transformative. “He can seize the world with a single word of His presence.”3\nThe next 14 groups include the quality of power.\n\n\n1.2.6 Lordship (51)\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas includes many different ways in describing the various ways God is Lord. The title of Lord is used to describe concepts such as the Lord of Beauty, of all Religion, of Grandeur, of the Seen and Unseen. Lordship can be defined as God’s ultimate authority. This authority would be over all creation and is derived from God’s knowledge and power. Lordship can discuss authority and governance. This authority is absolute, encompassing everything which is seen and unseen. Lordship is universal, transcending all divisions, stations, ranks, and beliefs.\nGod is the ruler over all creation, although as God is Subtlety, Lordship can also be a mystery. Lordship might be observed through the Manifestation of Signs, understood through Knowledge, witnessed through Creation, and felt through Power.\nThe next 13 groups include the quality of lordship.\n\n\n1.2.7 Justice (6)\nJustice is expressed through the names Judge, Just, and Reckoner. Justice can often be seen as the determination between right and wrong. It can also be viewed as the balance expressed through God’s Lordship. Although justice can often be immediately evident, Subtlety allows for justice to be precise, operating beyond the surface. This includes realities which can seem hidden, such as intentions, unseen consequences, or other spiritual conditions.\nJustice can be witnessed through the various signs manifested, especially in how perfectly ordered creation is. Justice requires the omniscience of God to truly be balanced, informed of every action, intention, and consequence. Justice is the fulfillment of the purpose of creation in an equitable way. Justice requires God’s power to be upheld. Power without justice can become tyranny. Justice ensures power is fair and equitable. All of creation benefits from justice.\nGod as an All-Capable Reckoner is able to calculate and account for all actions, intentions, and consequences, to include those seemingly unknown. God as the All-Knowing Judge determines the best rulings according to divine principles. Judgment and reckoning are required for justice to be implemented. As Lord, God’s justice becomes evident as does order within His governance.\nThe next 12 groups include the quality of justice.\n\n\n1.2.8 Exaltation (9)\nGod’s justice demonstrates God’s exalted nature. The names of Most Exalted, Most High, Great, Majestic, Most Glorious, and the Greatest Infallibility come from God’s role as Just. Without justice, God’s Power, Lordship, and Knowledge would be unworthy of exaltation. However, because of God’s Justice, nothing else in creation can be more exalted than God.\nGiven God’s Knowledge and Power, the Name of Greatest Infallibility demonstrates the fairness and righteousness of justice, showing that God does not and will not error. God’s Subtlety can make His Exaltation seem veiled, especially when compared to more superficial things we can place above ourselves, or when we place ourselves above everything. Subtlety is what creates awe and acknowledges the extraordinary nature, despite being incomprehensible. The Manifestation of the Signs and of God help reveal different aspects of God’s exalted nature.\nThe belief in God’s Exaltation is not because God feels jealousy if you do not, nor needs to be exalted to feel good. The belief in God’s Exaltation is a function of God’s Lordship and Justice above any other form of justice and authority.\nThe next 11 groups include the quality of exaltation.\n\n\n1.2.9 Independence (9)\nThe names of God in the group Independence include Self-Sufficient, Self-Subsisting, and Independent of All Worlds. It should be noted the Power group utilized the Name All-Sufficient. All-Sufficient demonstrates how God can suffice all things, whereas Self-Sufficient shows how God can suffice Himself without requiring any support from creation itself.\nGod has complete autonomy. God is independent of our own belief or exaltation. It also means God does not need anything in return in being Just, Almighty, All-Knowing, and Inaccessible. God acts only due to His own purpose. This purpose, this Cause, is solely for creation’s benefit. “Evil deeds do not harm Us, good deeds do not benefit Us”4 and due to this, God is free of corruption.5\nThe next 10 groups include the quality of independence.\n\n\n1.2.10 Command (6)\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas describes God as being the Commander, Ordainer, and Fulfiller. These names serve as the foundation for legislation and the exectution of this legislation. These roles in one way serves as the Word through which the entire framework of order, laws, directives, and intentions are used to shape the destiny of creation.\nIt would seem justice would require the command in practice. God cannot judge without establishing a standard to judge against. This would definitely be correct. With Commander being a Name of God, it is more about the attribute. In order for belief in God’s command to exist, one must believe in the attribute of Justice first. Otherwise, a person would not follow the command.\nSubtlety is still the foundation here within Command. Even a simple outward command could have significant and profound spiritual meaning. Believing in the Command thus, isn’t just merely acting on the command, but believing the Command itself has an inner essence full of mystery, spiritual progress, and deeper purpose within the grand scope of creation. The Command is bound within God’s All-Knowing nature and serves as the framework not just for people, but for all creation. Command acts through God’s Lordship and serves the balance of Justice. The Command is Exalted over any other command and is independent of everything other than God Himself.\nThe next 9 groups include the quality of command.\n\n\n1.2.11 Counsel (6)\nThe group counsel is informed by the names Counselor, Speaker, and Source of Inspiration. Unlike Command which is more about legislation, Counsel is more about helping navigate complex moral, spiritual, and practical challenges which may not have a clear prohibition. This compliments Command.\nBelief in God as a Counselor means you believe God can provide you with advice and wisdom. The originates from God being Wise and All-Informed. God can do this as the Speaker, using His Word or Manifestations of His Word to provide guidance at anytime. This guidance could be sought or offered voluntarily. These counsels, advice, and wisdom act within God’s name Source of Inspiration. The inspirations inspired could be inner understandings or renewed energies to act.\nCounsel interacts with Subtlety by allowing for a process of self-discovery through the hidden, inner dimensions of truth which may Manifest through Signs and Manifestations of God. While inspiration itself is a creation, effective counsel can help ensure a person may find harmony and balance within the framework of creation itself. Counsel could be highly contextual and individualized, which requires God’s knowledge to ensure relevance and timeliness. God’s counsel is authoritative as Lord and is another pathway to justice, as His counsel will be most fair and equitable. The Exalted nature of God ensures a sense of awe and respect for His wisdom. The counsel is effective through God’s independence, ensuring the counsel is solely for the benefit of creation, not from any need or want.\nThe next 8 groups include the quality counsel.\n\n\n1.2.12 Faithfulness (3)\nFaithfulness is a name or attribute rarely attributed to God, or at least in what I read and hear. Usually faithfulness is used only in the context of a person in relation to God or a significant loved one. This group is highlighted by the names in the Kitab-i-Aqdas of Trustworthy and Faithful Guardian.\nBelief in God as being Trustworthy is the result of believing God’s counsel and command. You can trust God’s command and counsel is not only wise, but upheld. They are not arbitrary or motivated in negative qualities such as selfishness. God can be relied upon in good times and in bad to exist within all the names expressed. God upholds His promises and fulfills His roles as Lord and Creator justly.\nGod is the Faithful Guardian. Being faithful, God is unwavering in His promises and in upholding justice. He is loyal to creation and being independent, is not affected by human actions or decisions. God being a guardian demonstrates an active role within creation. While God being Inaccessible may seem God is impersonal, this is quite far from the truth. Inaccessible is solely due to His exalted nature, not due to a lack of care or concern for creation. God is our guardian. Creation could face challenges, and God is able to protect it and guide it, ensuring it flourishes. Within humanity, God is like a shephard.\nBoth these names are a testament to the faithfulness of God, especially to each individual person although not exclusive to humanity. There is a steadfast commitment to our guidance, protection, and well-being. This should help encourage a sense of hope, trust, and gratitude in our own walks of faith.\nThe next 7 groups include the quality faithfulness.\n\n\n1.2.13 Praise (4)\nGod’s names in this group include All-Praised, Praised, and Praiseworthy. This demonstrates how created entities, not just humanity, praise God and His names. God is worthy of adoration due to how all of these prior names are manifested within creation.\nPraise can be for God’s Subtlety, awe, and wonderment. The hidden aspects of God’s nature invite reflection and admiration. Praise can be for God’s manifestations, helping to connect humanity to the divine. Praise can be for God’s omniscience, for understanding all things perfectly for the benefit of creation. Praise can be for creation itself, for its beauty, complexity, artistry, and magnificence. Praise can be for God’s power and Lordship, for the ability to govern, sustain, and transform creation into constantly better versions. Praise can be for God’s purpose and justice, for the assurance there is fairness and moral accountability. God deserves praise for being the Most High and Most Glorious, showing a deep reverence for His supreme nature. God can be praised for needing nothing but giving everything selflessly, being fully independent of creation. Praise is for God’s command, providing a moral and spiritual framework for all. Praise for laws which promote growth, harmony, justice, and peace. Praise can be for God’s counsel which ensures humanity can navigate life’s challenges in a wise and caring way. Praise is for God’s faithfulness in His consistent care and fulfillment of promises, for being steadfast in being an active part in developing our spiritual and material needs.\nThe next 6 groups include the quality of praise.\n\n\n1.2.14 Love (11)\nLove is probably the most often stated attribute of God. It would seem natural to place the Love grouping much earlier in this. Baha’u’llah says “I was in my ancient essence and eternal being when I knew my love for you; therefore, I created you, cast my image upon you, and revealed my beauty to you.”6 It appears love was the beginning, but the ancient essence of Subtlety is the beginning.\nBelieving in God the Subtlety can teach God’s presence is real, even when unseen. This is a foundation to prepare a believer to recognize love even in those troublesome and mysterious times. Love itself often seems hidden, which requires God to Manifest it. The Manifestation is the expression of love, which appears in signs, prophets, and scriptures. Manifestations help make love seem tangible instead of being inaccessible. As we see in the Hidden Word, God’s love is intentional, born through God’s knowledge. Love is purposeful and directed towards the well-being of all creation. Creation teaches our existence is an expression of love. Everything is the gift. Love is born from Power, as it is protective and able to sustain creation. Love without power is ineffective. Love has authority derived from God’s Lordship, expressed with authority. God’s love can lead one wisely. If Love wasn’t a result of Justice, it would not be perfectly balanced. God does not favor in Love, nor is inequitable. Discipline is not out of anger or jealousy, but is a method to guide and protect those He loves. The belief in God’s Exaltation also leads to feeling God’s Love is also Exaltation. It is higher than human love and is limitless. Love is not bound by any limitation and it is unconditional and constant. Independence teaches God loves not because God needs something from us, but because the Love is True. God is not dependent on our love, which means His Love is completely free. The Command of God demonstrates how Love provides direction through laws, teachings, and boundaries. Love is not merely only a feeling but God’s Love includes guidance. God’s Love is not silent and He can speak and inspire, providing loving counsel. Faithfulness teaches Love is reliable and any unreliable love is not love. Love is eternal, just as God is eternal. God will not abandon or forget His creation.\nOnce recognizing God’s greatness through these various names and attributes, Praise teaches God’s greatness naturally leads to Love. Feeling and understanding how wonderful God is, in all of these attributes, there is no other result to also love Him. Love itself is the highest form of praise. As an example of God’s Love, His names include Beloved, Loving, and Gracious.\nGrace is an attribute which encapsulates God’s Love succinctly. It is personal and relational. When we started with God as being inaccessible, God’s love is deeply personal. “I knew my Love for You.” Grace is intimate. Grace is the foundation of spiritual aid. Grace is Love in action. Grace is given even if it is not deserved. Every person, being created out of Love, is a recipient of Grace.\nThe next 5 groups include the quality of love.\n\n\n1.2.15 Forgiveness (15)\nForgiveness is one of the ultimate expressions of love. With the names of God including All-Forgiving, Ever-Forgiving, and Oft-Forgiving, we see forgiveness can include forgiving all transgressions, lasting eternally, and can occur with great frequency. There are no limitations on what can be forgiven for God and any forgiveness lasts forever. What is forgiven today will not be held against you tomorrow.\nBelieving in the Forgiveness of God does require believing in the qualities of God’s Love. Once we know love is not transactional and completely selfless, we can also believe forgiveness is all not transactional. Forgiveness shows unconditional care and devotion. The mistakes and failings of a person will not separate them from God. God, being the embodiment of Faithfulness, is steadfast in His Love and Forgiveness. No person is unworthy of forgiveness. Belief in God’s forgiveness also helps strengthen and secure one’s belief in the His love. It helps feel the love is constantly being expressed and renewed, whose purpose is to uplift creation. God’s command and counsel is not about creating a fear of punishment, but it is to deepen the relationship we have with God.\nThe next 4 groups include the quality of forgiveness.\n\n\n1.2.16 Mercy (29)\nMercy builds on forgiveness and is still sourced from God’s Love and His other attributes. Mercy includes the names All-Merciful, Most Merciful, and Most Compassionate. Forgiveness is a reaction to something gone wrong such as a mistake. Mercy is a proactive support for the future. Believing God is All-Merciful means you believe God knows, through His Knowledge, you will need help and assistance. You will be imperfect. Mercy is gentleness, patience, and protection. Mercy will help ensure we are guided away from that which harms us.\nGod being Most Compassionate shows God has sympathy and compassion for all of His creation, to include us. Mercy is the action used to express this compassion. For example, a parent can see their child wanting to learn how to walk. They see the difficulty the child has and compassion moves the parent to feel for the struggle. This moves the parent to want to comfort and encourage the child. Mercy is helping the child up if they did fall, making sure the child will not be harmed too much by falling, and guiding them so they can keep trying to walk. Eventually, this expression of love and nurture will lead to the success and growth of the child.\nGod’s Mercy is eternal, unconditional, powerful, and subtle. It can sometimes seem difficult to understand His Mercy when we are going through difficult times and His Mercy seems hidden. Yet, it is always there, invisibly ensuring our progress and success.\nThe next 3 groups include the quality of mercy.\n\n\n1.2.17 Generosity (22)\nGenerosity includes the names All-Bountiful, Bestower, Most Generous, and Most Bountiful. These three attributes highlight a natural progression of God’s love from Mercy. God being the Most Generous means He will give freely with love with no expectations of anything in return nor any limitation. God being All and Most Bountiful shows God will give with great abundance and encompasses all of creation. God being the Bestower demonstrates another aspect of a personal relationship. He will deliberately give blessings according to our needs and capacity. The abundance is intentional and specific. “God enriches who He wills through the means of the heaven and earth.”7\nGenerosity can be quite Subtle as He can give in ways which seem hidden or unnoticed. It can require perception and an open mind and open heart. These gifts are manifested in every aspect of life and are tangible and real. Knowledge can influence the bounty and bestowals by God knowing what to give, when to give, and how much to give. This generosity will be in ways which benefits all of creation, which itself is an act of generosity. As God’s Power is absolute, there is no constraints by need or scarcity. God can give without any limitations. Lordship is reflected because generosity as He is Lord of all Things, and all things are sustained under His care and authority. As God is Just, He will not give unequally or unfairly. The gifts may not be the same for all, but everyone will receive what they need. As God is exalted over all, His generosity is also spiritual in nature, not just material. It helps us connect with the divine. True generosity will not seek anything in return, showing God’s Independence. One of the greatest gifts God can provide is knowledge in how to live a righteous life through His command and counsel. These gifts allow us to thrive, not just merely survive. God’s generosity is faithful and unwavering. Even though belief in God’s praiseworthiness allows us to recognize His love and generosity, the generosity also gives us more reasons to offer praise to Him. We are moved to glorify Him. Forgiveness itself is an act of generosity, offering a fresh start and renewal.\nThe next 2 groups include generosity.\n\n\n1.2.18 Sovereignty (4)\nBelief in God as the Sovereign, Lord of Dominion, the Ruler, and the Master. It is a natural expansion of Lordship. A Lord focuses on the care and provision of creation, ensuring it is sustained and guided. A sovereign ruler has absolute rule and authority. The belief of God’s love, forgiveness, mercy, and generosity leads to believing in God’s ability to control and rule over all of existence.\nBelieving in God the Sovereign means you believe His authority is absolute and independent of any other authority. As a Ruler, there is belief He actively governs and ensures order. With God as the Master, He has personal ownership and control over all things. God expresses mastery over all matters. God’s Dominion is both the spiritual and physical worlds. This sovereignty is built upon all the other beliefs, names, and attributes expressed so far. It is continuous and never ends. Much like how God loves, it is built on faithfulness, forgiveness, mercy, and generosity according to the capacities of creation, capacities which can be ever-changing.\nRecognizing God’s sovereignty crowns this progression, affirming His ultimate control over all realms.\n\n\n1.2.19 Purity (9)\nPurity includes the names of Purest, True, and One. This is the pinnacle of belief in God. These names describe God’s transcendence, incorruptibility, and oneness. Being the Purest, God is beyond all imperfection and is entirely flawless. Nothing can limit or alter Him. Being True, God is constant and beyond any falsehood, while all else in creation is temporary. Being One, God is indivisible and without equal. There is no multiplicity of His essence and He is inclusive of all reality and of all creation.\nIn our journey through the groups, building our foundations of belief, we have an opportunity in believing in the true and transcendent nature of God. Without this journey, belief in God’s Purity or oneness might seem shallow. For example, what might be the consequence of believing God is One but lack belief in the other names of God?\nBelief in God’s Oneness without belief in God’s Subtlety might view God as being remote, causing a possible agnostic or deistic perspective. Belief in God’s Oneness without belief in God’s Manifestation would prevent the person from recognizing or connecting with the divine, causing a possible rejection of prophecy, scriptures, and religious teachings. Faith could be reduced to a mere philosophy instead of a living reality. Belief in God’s Oneness without belief in God’s Knowledge causes one to feel God lacks wisdom and His rulings imperfect and arbitrary. This could cause a fatalistic or impersonal view of God where He is not aware of individual lives.\nBelief in God’s Oneness without belief in God as Creator would remove God’s role as the source of existence. This would lead to pantheism or atheism. Belief in God’s Oneness without belief in God’s Power means His oneness is meaningless as He cannot act. This could lead to polytheism or dualism where other forces compete with God’s will. Belief in God’s Oneness without belief in God’s Lordship would mean God is unable to sustain or guide His creation. This could lead to nihilism. Belief in God’s Oneness without Justice might make it seem God is unconcerned with fairness or morality. This could lead to tyranny, cruelty, or oppressive religious views where oneness is used as the justification.\nBelief in God’s Oneness without Exaltation might make God seem too human, leading to anthropomorphism where God is viewed as a human-like figure. Belief in God’s Oneness without Independence would cause belief God needs something to exist, leading to a belief in paganism where others share divine authority. Belief in God’s Oneness without belief in His Command would lead to moral relativism where there are no consequences or ultimate justice, possibly no right or wrong. Belief in God’s Oneness without His Counsel would have one believe there is no divine wisdom guiding human affairs, leading to despair or confusion and potentially directionless.\nBelief in God’s Oneness without His Faithfulness could make God seem fickle and unreliable in fulfilling promises. This would lead to distrust in religion and a fear God is not dependable. Belief in Oneness but not belief in God’s praiseworthiness would mean worship has no meaning. God would not inspire love or devotion, leading to spiritual emptiness. Belief in Oneness with belief in God’s love makes oneness cold and rigid. It leads to fear-based religion, where obedience is motivated by dread. Belief in God’s Oneness without His forgiveness make God seem unapproachable and terrifying. This would lead to a legalistic religion where perfection is the only goal to prevent eternal condemnation.\nBelief in God’s Oneness without His Mercy is rigid and oppressive, leading to hopelessness and possibly depression, where a sinner may feel there is no way back to God or salvation. Belief in God’s Oneness without His generosity is a belief where creation is an accident and good things are merely a matter of luck. This could lead to pessimism where people believe God does not care about their well-being. Belief in God’s Oneness without His sovereignty could mean God has no impact and other forces could challenge Him. This also could lead to polytheism or deism where God’s rule is questioned, challenged, or replaced by others.\nBelief in God’s Purity leads to an understanding which there is no partner with God as the Greatest Infallibility8. No one else has been given a share in this station. This belief means God never errs and is absent of imperfection. Truth is never compromised. The essence of infallibility is oneness, as God cannot be divided against Himself.\nAs you can see, a lack of belief in any one of these names or attributes compromises belief in God’s purity, truth, and oneness. If any are missing, God cannot be truly be One and God cannot be True. With any missing, instead of religion we develop some other type of corrupt ideology which lack the completeness of truth, spirit, and experience.",

There are various answers throughout the writings of the Bab and Baha’u’llah. One answer by the Bab is “Your purpose for me is that I recognize You in all things, so that I may not be ignorant of You in anything.”10 Baha’u’llah also says “Whoever has known Me has known the intended purpose.”11\nBelief in these Names and attributes of God are a pathway to understanding what this purpose is.

If there is no movement due to the breath of God, the person or object is considered dead.16 Thus the breath of God is what gives life. Having both fragrance and life also means this breath can permeate and be deeply felt. Fragrance can attract others, but often fragrance can be hidden by other smells.\nThe breath of God cannot be confined, as itself is movement causing movement. It is spreading to those with a receptive nose or receptive soul. It is a sign of beauty and renewal. A fragrance does not discriminate and is able to permeate or be sensed by anyone open to it. Believing in God also means believing in the Breath.",

    "text": "2.1 Chapter Introduction\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas regularly describes the human soul and the station of humans and humanity. Baha’u’llah does not explicitly state a belief in the human soul is required in the Kitab-i-Aqdas or other writing, but like the belief in God, it is strongly implied. This will be the second foundation of this book upon which the Kitab-i-Aqdas rests upon.\nThe soul is an idea which is quite cross-cultural in that many distinct traditions describe the human soul in some way or another. Chapter 1 described how God is the creator of everything, is eternal, and other qualities which would testify to how distinct and seemingly disconnected cultures include such similar ideas. Each tradition may not say the exact same thing about the soul, such as the Hindu progress of the soul through various physical lifeforms or the Platonic concept of the distinct human soul, but the foundations of truth are all there. This chapter could potentially serve as a bridge between these various traditions and provide a clear understanding of the soul and allow cross-cultural and interfaith dialogue to exist. After all, we are all equally human.\nThis chapter will be divided into four main sections: the Reality of the Human Soul, the Unique Nature of the Soul, the Inner Struggles of the Soul, and the Fate of the Soul. These sections are derived from the Kitab-i-Aqdas as the primary source document. Any supplementation from other sources from the Bab and Baha’u’llah will be noted.",

    "section": "2.2 The Reality of the Human Soul",
    "text": "2.2 The Reality of the Human Soul\nThe first belief is the fact the human soul exists and is real. The soul in its form did not eternally pre-exist but was created by God. Baha’u’llah says simply we are created from water.1 Baha’u’llah says water is one of the key components of all creation, celestial and terrestial, along with fire, air, and earth as they combine to make heat, moisture, cold, and dryness. 2 He also describes various kinds of water used in the creation of spirit, soul, and body in the same tablet. Baha’u’llah describes the water of semen as being pure, not something itself which needs purified. 3 Water, regardless of the source, is the foundation of all life.\nBaha’u’llah says that we are brought to life with a spirit from God4, through the divine breath.5 All living things are animated by this breath of God, which is spirit itself. This breath works as the catalyst upon water and the other elements, giving life to everything living. This includes organic entities such as animals, plants, bacteria, and other things biology classifies as living. This spirit also is within other non-organic objects such as the sun, the moon, earth, and other objects whose lifespan endures for millions and billions of years. The spirit animates the body and it animates the human soul as well as the souls of endless creatures.6 The soul is not created at the moment of conception, as it does require the body to be the vessel and for its elements to reach a stage of maturity. Baha’u’llah does not exactly define when this exactly occurs but this could occur during embryonic of fetal development.\nThe human soul is the innermost part of ourselves. The soul provides the “direction of the spirit towards one orientation over others.”7 The soul can be ignited by fire of the love of God or by one’s own whim. This expresses the soul itself has free will. Despite God’s names and attributes of power and knowledge, God has imparted every thing made of spirit freedom to move as it wishes, according to its temperament and direction.\nBaha’u’llah expresses the all souls and all humans are Signs of the divine reality.8 In Chapter 1, we learned how these signs are subtle and when manifested, are a foundation for us in understanding God and His purpose. The soul is also a sign, functioning as a mirror capable of reflecting God’s reality. This is true for all people.9 The names and attributes are manifested in the human soul.10 This mirrorship is a way to recognize God within us.11 These manifestations of Signs can occur in the same way God’s names and attributes can also be believed in, perhaps in stages or through periods of continued realization.",

    "section": "2.3 The Unique Nature of the Soul",
    "text": "2.3 The Unique Nature of the Soul\nBaha’u’llah describes the body as being a temple, and the collection of all people as being temples of humankind.12 The figurative heart serves as a malleable lens within the body which serves to perceive divine truth. This helps a person with receptivity to God, which in turn helps a soul determine its destiny and spiritual path.\nThe Suriy-i-Haykal (Surah of the Temple) describes how Baha’u’llah, being a Manifestation of God, is a sacred vessel in the highest form. Every human body, although temporary, is also a sacred vessel although in a lower station than that of the Manifestation of God. The temple is temporary but is a place of worship and the development of spiritual qualities, according to its capacity as a mirror. This means the body is also capable of being used to nurture the soul, not just through material means but through being used for spiritually purposeful conduct and expression of divine attributes.\nThe soul is capable of having an exalted and noble station.13 There are various stations and ranks a soul is capable of achieving. The soul itself was born noble14 but requires effort to remain so by turning one’s sight inward. There is no higher station than a person bearing witness to God.15 The human soul’s natural station is higher than that of animals, but can descend to the level of an animal’s soul if it is neglected.16\nEach person and each soul has its own capacity.17 Not every person’s soul will express the divine attributes and names equally or in the same exact way. They are expressed according to one’s capacity.18 This means every soul may have its own distinct strengths and weaknesses, bound by the human temple and its position in time and space. These different combinations of capacity, reflections of divine names and attributes, and effects of the body ensures every soul is distinct, much like the iris of the eye or the lines of the palm of the hand.",

    "section": "2.4 The Inner Struggles of the Soul",
    "text": "2.4 The Inner Struggles of the Soul\nBaha’u’llah describes a suspicious soul19 as an opposition to one who uses reason. A suspicious soul could be someone who is ruled by doubt and is not sure who or what to trust. This doubt could be about God, God’s purpose, or even their own purpose in life. This skepticism may exist even if truth or a path forward is evident. They may not understand the good in certain situations, understand the potential wisdom in difficult situations, and due to this, lack discipline to truly submit to God. This lack of discipline could lead to self-destructive acts and habits, which can lead a person further down the road of headlessness and suspicion. A suspicious soul could be someone who is deceptive, also known as hypocritical. They may outwardly portray belief but inwardly or in private has other beliefs and actions.\nBaha’u’llah teaches these suspicions, as well as idols, act as idols.20 These idols are the cause of humiliation and loss and keep a soul from ascending to the station they are rightful to inherit and claim. However, the Kitab-i-Aqdas does include the most simple perspective to help alleviate these inner struggles the soul may face. Baha’u’llah says all are servants.21 The soul’s fundamental purpose is in relation to the divine. All souls are servants. Belief not only in the soul, but in the soul’s purpose as a servant of God. This establishes trust and humility, eliminating the symptoms of a suspicious soul such as distrust, skepticism, arrogance, or hypocrisy. Belief in servitude to God is the source of freedom for the soul22 and reveals our true human rank.23",

    "text": "2.5 The Fate of the Soul\nOne matter which is not a matter of belief is the fact death of the body is inevitable. This is 100% guaranteed and is inescapable. It is also 100% fact once the body has died, the energy which used to be within the body no longer exists within it. It is also 100% fact and proven by science that energy does not merely disappear or cease to exist. The energy goes elsewhere. Where does it go?\nBaha’u’llah reminds us we will return to dust.24 The temple of the human body will end. The soul will take flight.25 Taking flight symbolizes the soul’s transcendence over material life, to a real place higher than where it was. The soul is also capable of transcending the human body even before the body has perished, if a person so desires and believes. “If you are a person of mystery and longing, take flight with the wings of the saints’ aspirations so that you may see the secrets of the beloved and reach the light of the loved one. ‘Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.’”26 Baha’u’llah throughout His teachings reminds us the importance of the soul being allowed to take flight while the body is alive while constantly being aware of the inevitable flight when the body no longer exists. The first is not inevitable but desired by God, and the second is inevitable and desired for a believer and God. A suspicious soul might show fear for the second flight, fearing the end of everything. A soul in belief is prepared for flight.\nThe desired journey of the soul is onboard the Crimson Ark.27 It represents salvation and refuge, much like how the Noah’s Ark led the people of the time to salvation. Belief in the salvation of the soul during the life of the body and after is important, especially within the belief of all the names and attributes of God. The journey in the Crimson Ark requires belief in God, in all the names and attributes of God. The journey in the Crimson Ark requires belief that you have a soul. The journey in the Crimson Ark requires belief in everyone else also has a soul. The fate of the soul doesn’t require only consideration of your own salvation, but in the salvation of others.28 The fate of the soul requires a belief that other souls deserve salvation. All souls are capable of transcending the bounds of self and body. All souls are able to take flight.\nThe next chapter will discuss the potential destinations of the soul, the worlds of God.",

He knows the secrets of hearts and the glances of the scoffers. How many heedless souls have approached with purity, and We have seated them upon the throne of acceptance.

This means anyone under 15 years old should not be expected, required, or forced to pray, even if you are the parent of a child under 15 years old.\nPrayer is also not required if any person is ill or if they are in old age. Old age is not defined, but at this time is up to the believer. Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to.\nA woman who is menstrating does not have to perform obligatory prayer nor fast. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase “Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty” 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon.\nThe prayers, whether obligatory or not, are to be done on an individual basis and in private. The emphasis is the individual’s relationship with God and their individual spiritual journey. The exception to this is the Prayer for the Dead. All of these can be done in your native language, or any language you know where you understand what is being said.",

A rak’ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha’u’llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.",

    "text": "10.4 Time of Day\nThe obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThe small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.\nFor believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable. For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.\nDepending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha’u’llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.\nAs God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.\nNo matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.",

Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.\nToday, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don’t have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect.

This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.\nThe Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.\nThe person should be buried with spirit and fragrance.",

    "text": "10.8 No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing\nA person can wear their hair as they wish. Baha’u’llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha’u’llah states these rules were not in the Qur’an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish.\nI believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha’u’llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.\nA female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.\nThe clothes worn for prayer must be clean.",

Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.",

I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say “Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty” 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.\nIt should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer.

The men are to be able-bodied and have the means to do so. If a man is not able to, it will not be held against him. Women are not required to, but are also allowed to if they so choose.\nThis difference in ruling is not about gender inequality, or saying women are less able to perform pilgrimage. This is about women having less of an obligation in God’s eyes to perform a task. This is about mercy and generosity.",

It helps to feel that God is active in the hearts of the assembly and in the heart of the community.\nWhen it feels as though God is operating within the assembly, it also moves the heart in a way which gives peace and comfort. It is impossible not to be touched if you are seeking God as your Beloved. The Spirit working through the House and the assembly is a Spirit which can bring hope regardless of the circumstances in life.

And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise.”\nSurah Al-Layl (92:18)\n“Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification.”\n\nThese verses highlight zakát as a central tenet in Islam, stressing charity, compassion, and the purification of wealth.",

    "text": "21.11 Violent Acts\n\n21.11.1 Murder\nMurder is prohibited. This is the first clear prohibition in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. In the West, there are different definitions for homicide and murder, along with defining intention. In the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha’u’llah uses the Arabic word “al-qatl” (القتل), where upon the various types of murder add onto the base word qatl.\nThis means any loss of human life by another human is prohibited, whether intended or not. The impact of any loss of life by another person is too great. It weakens the fabric of the community, causes trauma, distrust, and potentially thoughts and feelings which can betray which God desires for us.\nIn another sense, it is an act of shirk, the Arabic concept of joining partners with God. Ultimately God has all power of creation, but murder is where a person tries to take this power away from God. The person is deciding when another’s spiritual journey will begin the next stage.\nThe punishment for the intentional act of murder is death, with the option for life imprisonment.\n\n\n21.11.2 Injuries to the Head and Body\nProhibited to assault anyone and cause injuries to the head and body.

    "text": "21.13 Sexual Acts\n\n21.13.1 Adultery\nAdultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.\nThere are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.\nAdultery is punishable by the House of Justice. For the 1st offense, 9 mithqáls of gold is to be paid to the House of Justice. This is paid by the man and also paid by the woman. For the 2nd offense, the fine is doubled to 18 mithqáls. To understand the valuation, the box below can show the current value of gold. 9 mithqáls is approximately 38.25g, so you would take the value of gold per gram and multiply it by 38.25, according to the currency you use. The default is US Dollars.\n\n\nThe third offence is subjected to a humiliating punishment. The specifics of this has not been clarified, but could be done so by a House of Justice if needed. Baha’u’llah says any person afflicted by sin should repent, although this does not necessarily absolve the person from being punished by the House of Justice.\n\n\n21.13.2 Lewdness\n\n\n21.13.3 Pederasty",

    "text": "21.14 Social Acts\n\n21.14.1 Backbiting\nBackbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.\nAdditionally, Baha’u’llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say “I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?” The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.\nThe backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.\nNow, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.\nFinally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha’u’llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?\n\n\n21.14.2 Slander\nSlander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another’s reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.\n\n\n21.14.3 Do Not Cause Corruption\n\n\n21.14.4 Do Not Cause Enmity\n\n\n21.14.5 Do Not Cause Discord\n\n\n21.14.6 Reconcile Differences\n\n\n21.14.7 Do Not Boast Over Another",

    "section": "22.2 Marriage",
    "text": "22.2 Marriage\nMarriage is enjoined upon us. Enjoined is an authoritative instruction or directive which implies it is either required or highly encouraged. The same word is used regarding prayer and fasting, which is usually interpreted to mean as they are required, pending acceptable exceptions.\n\n22.2.1 Purpose of Marriage\nThe purpose of marriage is to have at least one child, a child who will remember God.\n\n\n22.2.2 Monogamy or Bigamy\nThe man is allowed up to two wives. More than two wives is not allowed. The man who is content with one wife with ensure both of their tranquility. This implies there can be complicating issues with polygamy. The first ones I can think of could be jealousy or a fear from the wife that perhaps she is not good enough to completely satisfy her husband. Insecurity definitely impacts tranquility. This means monogamy is preferred, although it is not required.\nThere is no rule which explicitly expresses a limitation on the number of husbands she can have. However, in regards to the teachings Baha’u’llah offers in his letters to Shiraz, he unequivacally states women are equal to men. Perhaps then, this is also applies to marriage law although there is no evidence a Baha’i woman ever married two men in the time of Baha’u’llah. This could merely be a function of Baha’is being subjected to Islamic law, which had a clear prohibition of female polygamy.\n\n\n22.2.3 Consent of Both Partners and Parents\nBoth the man and woman must consent to marriage. Neither can be forced to marry against their wishes. Also, marriage requires the person of all parents of both the bride and the groom. Baha’u’llah says it is to prevent discord or resentment among may arise the couple.\nThis also does not mean there must be arranged marriages.\nHe also says there are other purposes.\n\n\n22.2.4 Virginity\nThe husband is allowed to choose a virgin, but it is not a requirement. The implication of this verse is there is no punishment for the woman if she is not a virgin.\n\n\n22.2.5 Dowry\nA marriage cannot be consummated without the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride. If the couple lives in the city, the dowry is based on 19 mithqáls (92.34) of gold. If they are in a village, 19 mithqáls of silver. The groom can give up to 95 mithqáls, but is not allowed to exceed it.\n\n22.2.5.1 Gold\n\n\n\n\n22.2.5.2 Silver\n\n\nThere isn’t anything specified if one person lives in a city and the other in a village. My initial feeling is it is based on the groom’s location or potentially where the married couple intends on living together once married.\nDowry is intended to be a gift which demonstrates the seriousness and sincerity of the man towards the woman. It can also help provide a safety net in case of some unexpected event or hardship for the woman.\n\n\n\n22.2.6 Travel and Abandonment\nThe following discusses the husband’s role and will be framed in that context. However, this should also be able to apply if the spousal roles within the particular marriage are reversed, given the equality of men and women.\nThe husband is allowed to travel away from home. He must tell his wife how long he will be gone. If he returns and fulfills his promise, he is considered among the righteous.\nIf he is unable to return at the original specified time and has a genuine reason, he must inform his wife and make every effort to return at the newly specified time. He only has one chance. If he does not inform her of the delay, the wife is free to find another husband 9 months after the original return date. If he does not return by the second time, she is also free to find another husband 9 months after. The wife does not have to find a new husband. Baha’u’llah says God loves those who are patient, but this does not imply the woman would be loved less if she found a new husband.\nDuring the 9 month waiting period, if news reaches her about her husband, she can choose to continue her marriage. She is not required to. God prefers reconciliation, but there should also be no actions which cause enmity.\nIf the husband passed away or was murdered, confirmed by a news report or 2 just witnesses, anytime during his travel, she also must wait. This could be 9 months, which can give time to grieve. After this, she may find a new husband if she chooses.\nIf the husband and wife travel together and discord arises between them, the husband must provide the wife with a full year’s allowance and return her to where she departed, such as home. The other option is to entrust her to a trustworthy person and whatever is needed to take her to her destination. It would seem the full year’s allowance is independent of the requirement to get his wife home. Also, it would also seem there would be room for both to consult on what would be best, such as how much is the allowance.\n\n\n22.2.7 Spirit of Joy and Fragrance\nAssociate with each other in a spirit of joy and fragrance. All that will endure are righteous deeds.\n\n\n22.2.8 Oppression and Lewdness\n\n\n22.2.9 Do Not Follow a Tyrannical and Wretched One",

Still, divorce is allowed.\nNo one is allowed to divorce each other three times.\n\n22.4.1 The Waiting Period\nDivorce is allowed if discord or aversion arises, but divorce cannot happen immediately. The couple must wait a year after the intention to divorce is expressed, with the hope the fragrance of love may emanate between them. At the end of the year, if no such fragrance emerged, then divorce is allowed. This also means if the married couple had sex in any form during the year, divorce is not allowed. The husband and wife must be consistent in their intentions.\nAn allowance will be given to the wife if there is no proven misconduct. The allowance is for the entire year.\nIf the two divorce, they do have the option to reconcile within one month if neither has married. Baha’u’llah emphasizes mutual love and consent. If the woman has a new husband, a new union is required to restore the relationship. This could mean the original husband would need to go through the original steps to marry, such as having the consent of both sets of parents, the payment of dowry, and a completely new marriage. On the woman’s side, it only expresses love and consent, without an explicit requirement to be divorced or unmarried.\n\n\n22.4.2 Divorce for Misconduct\nIf the wife is divorced for proven misconduct, she will not have any allowance during the waiting period.",

This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.\nThere is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha’u’llah’s command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved’s life is beneficial for the community.",

Has the intoxication of desire seized you, or are you among the heedless?\n\n\n30.4.2 To the Point on the Shore of Two Seas (Istanbul)\nThe throne of oppression has been established upon you, and the fire of hatred has been ignited within you to such an extent that it has caused lamentation in the Concourse on high and those who circle around the exalted Throne. We see within you the ignorant ruling over the wise, and darkness boasting over the light, while you are in manifest delusion. Your outward adornment has deceived you. By the Lord of creation! It will perish, and the daughters and widows, and the tribes among you, shall weep. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed give you tidings.\n\n\n30.4.3 To the Banks of the Rhine River\nWe have seen you covered with blood, as the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and again you shall have it.\nFranco-Prussian War in early 1870s. Prophecy of new blood.\n\n\n30.4.4 The Lamentation of Berlin\nWe hear the lamentation of Berlin, though she is now in manifest glory.\n\n\n30.4.5 To The Land of Ṭā (Tehran)\ndo not grieve over anything, for God has made you the source of the world’s joy. Should He so will, He may bless your throne with one who will rule with justice and gather the scattered sheep of God from the wolves. He shall greet the people of Bahá with joy and gladness. Rejoice in that God has made you the horizon of light (Ta means light or illumination), for in you was born the Dawn of Manifestation, and you were named with this name by which the light of grace shone forth and the heavens and the earth were illumined. Things will be overturned within you, and the masses shall pass judgment upon you. Verily, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Be at peace through the grace of your Lord; indeed, the moments of divine bounty shall not cease from you. Tranquility shall follow the turmoil. Thus has the matter been decreed in a wondrous Book.\n\n\n30.4.6 To the Land of Khá (Khurasan)\nO Land of Khá! We hear within you the voices of men extolling your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Blessed is the day when the banners of the Names are raised in the Kingdom of Creation in My Most Glorious Name. On that day, the sincere will rejoice in the victory of God, while the disbelievers will lament.\n\n\n30.4.7 To the Land of Kāf and Rā\nO land of Kāf and Rā’, We see you upon that which is not beloved by God, and We see from you what none but God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, has witnessed. We perceive what passes from you in the innermost secret of secrets. With Us is the knowledge of all things inscribed in a clear Tablet. Do not grieve over this, for God will cause to appear in you those of mighty power who will mention Me with steadfastness. They will not be hindered by the insinuations of the learned, nor veiled by the doubts of the skeptics. These are they who behold God with their own eyes and assist Him with their very selves.

This means there should be a perspective that within the House of Justice, God is presiding. The Houses of Justice are one of the first official organizations established by God to promote justice and governance. Unlike most religious institutions, it is not designed for worship or other religious acts. Still, this does not mean the members should not act as if their roles are separate from their beliefs, nor separate from the rest of the commands of the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThey will act as the trusted ones and representatives of God for all who dwell on Earth. The functions of a trustee, representative, and other roles will be discussed later, but it should be important to note the trustees and representatives must have the perspective towards all of humankind, not just believers of God and Baha’u’llah. This\nThey should also consult on the welfare of the servants, those who do believe in God and Baha’u’llah. This welfare, affairs, and consultation would not operate as a clergy, but help ensure the community in each city is taking care of each other according to the guidance given by God.\nThe members are also commanded to not neglect anything explicitly stated within the Tablet. This demonstrates how important the role of the Houses of Justice serve.\nAct in accordance with the ordinances and laws of God, and guard them as you would your eyes, and be not of the losers.",
