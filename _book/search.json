    "text": "Praise be to God, the Creator of and Source of all inspiration, knowledge, and wisdom!\nAllah’u’abha!\nThe Bab and Baha’u’llah, from 1844 to 1892, ushered in a new era for all mankind. The culmination of their revelations, the Bayan by the Bab in 1848, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha’u’llah in 1873, offer the framework to develop individuals, communities, and nations in a newly spiritual way. The Bayan, which was unfinished prior to the Bab’s execution in 1850, was symbolically completed by the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Up until this point in 2025, there have been no English language studies of the entire Kitab-i-Aqdas. This is partially because many followers of Baha’u’llah merely view the book as only a book of laws, partially because it was not translated until over a 100 years after its completion, and partially because other authors are more preeminent among communities which believe in Baha’u’llah.\nThis book aims to place the Kitab-i-Aqdas in the exalted position it deserves to be. To do this, we need to understand the Kitab-i-Aqdas is more than a book of laws, it is the framework for God’s will, which is to guide people towards salvation, to create distinct spiritual communities, and to bring about unity among the people of the world. The Bayan will be used as a primary supplement, as well as other writings by Baha’u’llah. No other sources will be considered. It is a technique which is rarely used, to use Scripture to explain Scripture.\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas makes no claim of starting completely from scratch, to not have any prior origins or inspirations. It also does not deny the reality of the ways of the world in which it was created. The world was already deep into the Industrial Revolution and on the cusp of the Modern age. Some societies were progressing in certain qualities more than others, which brought with each certain strengths and certain weaknesses. What the Kitab-i-Aqdas does is act like a composer of music, taking instruments which already exist, notes and chords which already exist, and using them to create an entirely new composition. This composition is entirely unique in itself, but shouldn’t be terribly strange to anyone. When listened to in its entirety, you will feel its vibrations within your soul, a soul which does yearn to have a relationship with the divine. This composition is itself a new technique able to create more heavenly compositions, where the compositions are the various organizations of society. This has its place to refine what already exists so that mankind can be prepared, guided, and inspired to continue its progress into perpetual tomorrow, a tomorrow of hope, love, and if so desired, peace.\nI make no claim of expertise, divinity, or scholarly prowess. I do not claim where the contents of this book is the only way to interpret the Kitab-i-Aqdas. My perspective is but one perspective and my hope is more authors offer their own perspectives on this magnificent work. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is worthy of scholarship and a place on every bookshelf, coffeetable, and handbag.\nThis book will be divided into six parts. The first part will be the pillars of belief and will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. The second part will focus on the relationship we are capable of having with God. After this, we will cover the life of the individual, which will build off the first two parts. The life of the individual will focus a more legalistic approach that will guide a person’s everyday actions and attitude. The fourth part will expand the life of the individual to community and family life. The fifth part will focus the prior two parts towards those who lead, who bear more responsibility than those who do not. The final part will discuss the Houses of Justice, whose purpose requires all the lessons learned from the prior five parts.\nI am grateful you have given this book a chance to be read. Thank you!",

    "text": "2.1 The Lord of all Religions\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas’s first five verses set the table for the foundation of faith. The first foundation is a belief in God, who is the Lord of all Religions.\nThe first question a person could have would be what qualifies as a religion? So far in the writings of Baha’u’llah, there is nothing in particular which qualifies what makes a religion true or false. There are exhortations saying some scriptures are true, but Baha’u’llah does not say other religions who do not have a scripture are not true. Scriptures does not equal religion as many religions exist without formal scripture.\nBaha’u’llah does refer to the practices of various faiths in the surrounding areas, such as ascetic practices of Hinduism.\nReligion is any faith-based practice which has some kind of ritual, tradition, mode of worship, and a belief in at least one diety. The word “all” is the most inclusive word one can use. If a person were to ask “Is God the Lord of so-and-so religion?” the answer should always be “yes.”\nThe Kitab-i-Ahd reminds the people to always remember “All is from God.” This phrase is the very foundation of belief. All is from God. It is also the foundation of unity. With God being One, All is also One, even when there are differing attributes and qualities being expressed and observed. Even in polytheistic traditions, all is from God. If a religion has a practice which is different from another religion, all is from God.",

A rak’ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha’u’llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.",

    "text": "11.4 Time of Day\nThe obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThe small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.\nFor believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable. For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.\nDepending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha’u’llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.\nAs God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.\nNo matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.",

It also served as the final stronghold for Christian Crusaders before they were defeated by the Mamluks. Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.\nToday, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don’t have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect.

This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.\nThe Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.\nThe person should be buried with spirit and fragrance.",

    "text": "11.8 No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing\nA person can wear their hair as they wish. Baha’u’llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha’u’llah states these rules were not in the Qur’an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish.\nI believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha’u’llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.\nA female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.\nThe clothes worn for prayer must be clean.",

Baha’u’llah has abrogated this and says we only need to say, ““Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.”\nThe verse is a great reminder in times of fear and distress. Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.",

I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say “Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty” 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.\nIt should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer.

Say, it draws pure hearts to spiritual worlds that cannot be expressed by words nor pointed to by signs. Blessed are those who listen.\nDo not conduct remembrance in the streets or marketplaces. Do so in a place designated for remembrance or in your home. This is closer to sincerity and piety.\nRecite the verses of God every morning and evening. He who does not recite has not fulfilled the covenant of God and His testament, and whoever turns away from it today is among those who turned away from God in the eternity of eternities. If one should read a single verse with spirit and joy, it is better for him than to recite the holy scriptures of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, with listlessness.\nRecite the verses of God to the extent that you are not overcome by weariness or sadness.\nDo not burden souls with what will make them lethargic and heavy; rather, give them what will lighten them, so they may soar with the wings of the verses to the dawn of clear evidences.",

God is Mighty and Forgiving. There are no exclusions based on any act, any perspective, or the like. The Aqdas does say the first command is about believing, which without belief makes you in error no matter what good deed you do. Without belief, you wouldn’t even seek forgiveness from God.

He said: With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and practise regular Charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”\nSurah Al-Mu’minun (23:4)\n“Who are active in deeds of charity.”\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:43)\n“And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).”\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:110)\n“And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah: for Allah sees Well all that ye do.”\nSurah An-Nisa (4:77)\n“Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity?”\nSurah At-Tawbah (9:5)\n“But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”\nSurah At-Tawbah (9:11)\n“But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity, they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand.”\nSurah At-Tawbah (9:18)\n“The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity, and fear none (at all) except Allah. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance.”\nSurah At-Tawbah (9:60)\n“Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.”\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:177)\n“It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards the East or the West; but it is righteousness – to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practise regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing.”\nSurah Maryam (19:55)\n“He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord.”\nSurah Al-Baqarah (2:267)\n“O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably) earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you, and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants, and worthy of all praise.”\nSurah Al-Layl (92:18)\n“Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification.”\n\nThese verses highlight zakát as a central tenet in Islam, stressing charity, compassion, and the purification of wealth.",

It weakens the fabric of the community, causes trauma, distrust, and potentially thoughts and feelings which can betray which God desires for us.\nIn another sense, it is an act of shirk, the Arabic concept of joining partners with God. Ultimately God has all power of creation, but murder is where a person tries to take this power away from God. The person is deciding when another’s spiritual journey will begin the next stage.\nThe punishment for the intentional act of murder is death, with the option for life imprisonment.\n\n\n22.11.2 Injuries to the Head and Body\nProhibited to assault anyone and cause injuries to the head and body. This includes intentional acts but could possibly also include unintentional acts, such as accidents or from gross negligence.\n\n\n22.11.3 Retaliation\nDo not object to another, nor take one life for another.\n\n\n22.11.4 Manslaughter\nPay 100 mithqals of gold (425g or 15oz).",

    "text": "22.13 Sexual Acts\n\n22.13.1 Adultery\nAdultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.\nThere are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.\nAdultery is punishable by the House of Justice. For the 1st offense, 9 mithqáls of gold is to be paid to the House of Justice. This is paid by the man and also paid by the woman. For the 2nd offense, the fine is doubled to 18 mithqáls. To understand the valuation, the box below can show the current value of gold. 9 mithqáls is approximately 38.25g, so you would take the value of gold per gram and multiply it by 38.25, according to the currency you use. The default is US Dollars.\n\n\nThe third offence is subjected to a humiliating punishment. The specifics of this has not been clarified, but could be done so by a House of Justice if needed. Baha’u’llah says any person afflicted by sin should repent, although this does not necessarily absolve the person from being punished by the House of Justice.\n\n\n22.13.2 Lewdness\n\n\n22.13.3 Pederasty",

    "text": "22.14 Social Acts\n\n22.14.1 Backbiting\nBackbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.\nAdditionally, Baha’u’llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say “I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?” The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.\nThe backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.\nNow, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.\nFinally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha’u’llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?\n\n\n22.14.2 Slander\nSlander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another’s reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.\n\n\n22.14.3 Do Not Cause Corruption\n\n\n22.14.4 Do Not Cause Enmity\n\n\n22.14.5 Do Not Cause Discord\n\n\n22.14.6 Reconcile Differences\n\n\n22.14.7 Do Not Boast Over Another",

    "text": "23.2 Marriage\nMarriage is enjoined upon us. Enjoined is an authoritative instruction or directive which implies it is either required or highly encouraged. The same word is used regarding prayer and fasting, which is usually interpreted to mean as they are required, pending acceptable exceptions.\n\n23.2.1 Purpose of Marriage\nThe purpose of marriage is to have at least one child, a child who will remember God.\n\n\n23.2.2 Monogamy or Bigamy\nThe man is allowed up to two wives. More than two wives is not allowed. The man who is content with one wife with ensure both of their tranquility. This implies there can be complicating issues with polygamy. The first ones I can think of could be jealousy or a fear from the wife that perhaps she is not good enough to completely satisfy her husband. Insecurity definitely impacts tranquility. This means monogamy is preferred, although it is not required.\nThere is no rule which explicitly expresses a limitation on the number of husbands she can have. However, in regards to the teachings Baha’u’llah offers in his letters to Shiraz, he unequivacally states women are equal to men. Perhaps then, this is also applies to marriage law although there is no evidence a Baha’i woman ever married two men in the time of Baha’u’llah. This could merely be a function of Baha’is being subjected to Islamic law, which had a clear prohibition of female polygamy.\n\n\n23.2.3 Consent of Both Partners and Parents\nBoth the man and woman must consent to marriage. Neither can be forced to marry against their wishes. Also, marriage requires the person of all parents of both the bride and the groom. Baha’u’llah says it is to prevent discord or resentment among may arise the couple.\nThis also does not mean there must be arranged marriages.\nHe also says there are other purposes.\n\n\n23.2.4 Virginity\nThe husband is allowed to choose a virgin, but it is not a requirement. The implication of this verse is there is no punishment for the woman if she is not a virgin.\n\n\n23.2.5 Dowry\nA marriage cannot be consummated without the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride. If the couple lives in the city, the dowry is based on 19 mithqáls (92.34) of gold. If they are in a village, 19 mithqáls of silver. The groom can give up to 95 mithqáls, but is not allowed to exceed it.\n\n23.2.5.1 Gold\n\n\n\n\n23.2.5.2 Silver\n\n\nThere isn’t anything specified if one person lives in a city and the other in a village. My initial feeling is it is based on the groom’s location or potentially where the married couple intends on living together once married.\nDowry is intended to be a gift which demonstrates the seriousness and sincerity of the man towards the woman. It can also help provide a safety net in case of some unexpected event or hardship for the woman.\n\n\n\n23.2.6 Travel and Abandonment\nThe following discusses the husband’s role and will be framed in that context. However, this should also be able to apply if the spousal roles within the particular marriage are reversed, given the equality of men and women.\nThe husband is allowed to travel away from home. He must tell his wife how long he will be gone. If he returns and fulfills his promise, he is considered among the righteous.\nIf he is unable to return at the original specified time and has a genuine reason, he must inform his wife and make every effort to return at the newly specified time. He only has one chance. If he does not inform her of the delay, the wife is free to find another husband 9 months after the original return date. If he does not return by the second time, she is also free to find another husband 9 months after. The wife does not have to find a new husband. Baha’u’llah says God loves those who are patient, but this does not imply the woman would be loved less if she found a new husband.\nDuring the 9 month waiting period, if news reaches her about her husband, she can choose to continue her marriage. She is not required to. God prefers reconciliation, but there should also be no actions which cause enmity.\nIf the husband passed away or was murdered, confirmed by a news report or 2 just witnesses, anytime during his travel, she also must wait. This could be 9 months, which can give time to grieve. After this, she may find a new husband if she chooses.\nIf the husband and wife travel together and discord arises between them, the husband must provide the wife with a full year’s allowance and return her to where she departed, such as home. The other option is to entrust her to a trustworthy person and whatever is needed to take her to her destination. It would seem the full year’s allowance is independent of the requirement to get his wife home. Also, it would also seem there would be room for both to consult on what would be best, such as how much is the allowance.\n\n\n23.2.7 Spirit of Joy and Fragrance\nAssociate with each other in a spirit of joy and fragrance. All that will endure are righteous deeds.\n\n\n23.2.8 Oppression and Lewdness\n\n\n23.2.9 Do Not Follow a Tyrannical and Wretched One",

The couple must wait a year after the intention to divorce is expressed, with the hope the fragrance of love may emanate between them. At the end of the year, if no such fragrance emerged, then divorce is allowed. This also means if the married couple had sex in any form during the year, divorce is not allowed. The husband and wife must be consistent in their intentions.\nAn allowance will be given to the wife if there is no proven misconduct. The allowance is for the entire year.\nIf the two divorce, they do have the option to reconcile within one month if neither has married. Baha’u’llah emphasizes mutual love and consent. If the woman has a new husband, a new union is required to restore the relationship. This could mean the original husband would need to go through the original steps to marry, such as having the consent of both sets of parents, the payment of dowry, and a completely new marriage. On the woman’s side, it only expresses love and consent, without an explicit requirement to be divorced or unmarried.\n\n\n23.4.2 Divorce for Misconduct\nIf the wife is divorced for proven misconduct, she will not have any allowance during the waiting period.",

    "text": "24.10 The Spiritual Aspect of Inheritance\nThroughout the verses regarding inheritance, Baha’u’llah reminds us that God is bountiful and merciful. No matter the amount of inheritance provided, any person who receives some should be grateful for the bounty provided. There are no exceptions based upon judgments of character or other qualifications to receive. This ensures there is no vying for an increased portion, or any attempts to deny another their portion. This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.\nThere is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha’u’llah’s command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved’s life is beneficial for the community.",

When the truth appeared, he and others like him turned away, while one who winnowed wheat and barley turned toward God. He spent his nights and days writing, as he claimed, the judgments of God, but when the Chosen One appeared, not a single letter of his work availed him. Had it benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face through which the countenances of the near ones are illumined. If you had believed in God at His appearance, the people would not have turned away from Him, and what has befallen Us today would not have occurred. Fear God and do not be among the heedless.\nHe was a the author of “Jawāhir al-kalām fī sharḥ sharāʾiʿ al-islām,” a book about Shi’a jurisprudence.",

Unlike most religious institutions, it is not designed for worship or other religious acts. Still, this does not mean the members should not act as if their roles are separate from their beliefs, nor separate from the rest of the commands of the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThey will act as the trusted ones and representatives of God for all who dwell on Earth. The functions of a trustee, representative, and other roles will be discussed later, but it should be important to note the trustees and representatives must have the perspective towards all of humankind, not just believers of God and Baha’u’llah. This\nThey should also consult on the welfare of the servants, those who do believe in God and Baha’u’llah. This welfare, affairs, and consultation would not operate as a clergy, but help ensure the community in each city is taking care of each other according to the guidance given by God.\nThe members are also commanded to not neglect anything explicitly stated within the Tablet. This demonstrates how important the role of the Houses of Justice serve.\nAct in accordance with the ordinances and laws of God, and guard them as you would your eyes, and be not of the losers.",
