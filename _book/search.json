    "text": "What could a community be like if the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha’u’llah is the primary source of guidance? As of this writing, there have been no distinct communities which emphasize the fullness of the Aqdas. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is addressed to all of creation and for the people of Baha.\nMy goal is to take a loving look in the Aqdas, use Baha’u’llah’s teachings to explain and expand upon concepts, and to use whatever inspiration I have access to at least demonstrate the potentials the Aqdas has for you, for me, and for the rest of us who believe in Baha’u’llah.\nThis book is merely my own personal understanding and perspective, just one way to look at it. Perhaps you may also have your own way as well. I welcome any discussion of this book, the Aqdas, and the building of distanct Aqdas communities. Thank you!",

    "text": "2.1 The Lord of all Religions\nThe Kitab-i-Aqdas’s first five verses set the table for the foundation of faith. The first foundation is a belief in God, who is the Lord of all Religions.\nThe first question a person could have would be what qualifies as a religion? So far in the writings of Baha’u’llah, there is nothing in particular which qualifies what makes a religion true or false. There are exhortations saying some scriptures are true, but Baha’u’llah does not say other religions who do not have a scripture are not true. Scriptures does not equal religion as many religions exist without formal scripture.\nBaha’u’llah does refer to the practices of various faiths in the surrounding areas, such as ascetic practices of Hinduism.\nReligion is any faith-based practice which has some kind of ritual, tradition, mode of worship, and a belief in at least one diety. The word “all” is the most inclusive word one can use. If a person were to ask “Is God the Lord of so-and-so religion?” the answer should always be “yes.”\nThe Kitab-i-Ahd reminds the people to always remember “All is from God.” This phrase is the very foundation of belief. All is from God. It is also the foundation of unity. With God being One, All is also One, even when there are differing attributes and qualities being expressed and observed. Even in polytheistic traditions, all is from God. If a religion has a practice which is different from another religion, all is from God.",

The Kitab-i-Aqdas was first written in 1873, so this could mean at least by the year 2873. The proclamation would include a command of new revelation which could change the law of God. This also ensures there is a duration in the implementation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas to allow for the development of the nations.\nAnyone who makes such a proclamation without later repenting will be punished severely by God. No one else has any authority to punish such a person.",

Any person who is not required to pray may do so if they feel compelled to.\nA woman who is menstrating does not have to perform obligatory prayer nor fast. She is to perform the ablutions and repeat the phrase “Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty” 95 times in a 24-hour period starting at noon.\nThe prayers, whether obligatory or not, are to be done on an individual basis and in private. The emphasis is the individual’s relationship with God and their individual spiritual journey. The exception to this is the Prayer for the Dead.

A rak’ah is a sequence of movements performed during the prayer, such as prostrating and standing up. However, after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed, Baha’u’llah provided three different obligatory prayers. One can be chosen each day. The small prayer is quite short and can be remembered and conducted quite easily. The midmost prayer follows the structure most like the original obligatory prayer and can take a few minutes to perform. The great prayer is designed more for a deep meditation which can take at least fifteen minutes. All of the times can vary depending on if you sing, take time to reflect on the words, or even repeat some of the invocations.",

    "text": "9.4 Time of Day\nThe obligatory prayer was originally to be performed three times per day. Once in the morning between sunrise until noon. The second time would be between noon and sunset. The final time is from sunset until two hours after sunset. These instructions follow with the midmost prayer, which is designed most closely to the original prayer prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.\nThe small prayer is to be performed at noon, which is from noon until sunset. The great prayer is to be performed anytime in the 24 hour period.\nFor believers who are in high latitudes where the time of day can vary greatly depending on the season, the use of watches and clocks to determine prayer times are acceptable. For example, in Calgary, Canada, sunset is close to 10pm during the summer solstice and closer to 8pm during the spring equinox. In Quito, Equador, sunset was at 6:21pm. In Quito, sunset is usually around the same time due to its location at the equator. A person in Calgary could choose to do the evening prayer closer to 8pm year-round as that could be similar to the spring equinox, or maybe they choose a random location near the equator such as in Quito. Any of these alternatives are acceptable as it can be reasonably be sunset somewhere in that longitude.\nDepending on perspective, one may feel a longer prayer will have more merit than the other, but really Baha’u’llah did not say either is preferred. The intention is to follow your own heart and express your spirit depending on your own circumstances each day. It is important that it is performed daily, as prayer is the foundation of a loving relationship with God.\nAs God has also prescribed work as an act of worship, I would recommend not getting too concerned about how to balance a busy lifestyle with the devotional act of prayer. This will develop naturally as your relationship grows. You will start to develop a sense of when you need to pray, or which prayer is the best for that day. I have found the great prayer difficult to recite word for word. When I get a little lost, I paraphrase or just start expressing what feels right within myself. Sometimes I also use prerecorded music to guide me.\nNo matter what, the important aspect is that prayer is done at least once per day.",

It also served as the final stronghold for Christian Crusaders before they were defeated by the Mamluks. Today Acre is a diverse small city with a well-balanced mix of people of various religions.\nToday, there are various apps which can be used to determine the most correct direction for prayer. However, if you are travelling and don’t have a tool to use, it is acceptable to face the direction you feel is the most right. As with everything in religion, intention is the most important aspect.

This second option is to say Allahu-Akbar six times. The prayer is performed during Qunut, which is based on the Muslim tradition of praying in a standing position, with the palms facing outward towards the sky. The Qunut is also a part of the obligatory prayers and signifies a position and condition of praise towards God. No other requirements exist in the prayer for the dead.\nThe Prayer for the Dead is the only prayer allowed to be performed in a congregation. This is a beautiful way for a community to honor the life of a loved one. With the repetition of the six verses 19 times, this can create a powerfully emotional experience as the departed journeys towards God.",

    "text": "9.8 No Restrictions on Hair and Clothing\nA person can wear their hair as they wish. Baha’u’llah refers to bones and the like as not being able to invalidate the prayer. The clothing materials worn during prayer also do not invalidate prayer. These are items which religious scholars and leaders had often described as making a person impure, or their prayer to have less effect. It is a primary reason why you might see a Muslim woman put on a clean and white outer garment before she prays. Baha’u’llah states these rules were not in the Qur’an and in the Aqdas, He is explicitly stating a believer can wear their hair and clothing as they wish.\nI believe the main purpose of this is to demonstrate what truly matters in prayer is the spirit and sincerity of the person. Baha’u’llah and God are for the reformation of hearts, and prayer is spiritual communion with God. With prayer also meant to be done in private, it also helps demonstrate the fact that God does not see us as these sexual creatures, or with sexual eyes. He sees our spirit. He feels our soul. The rules by scholars who say otherwise are attributing desire on God, giving God human and animal attributes falsely.\nA female believer can also interpret these lack of restrictions as they please. Could a woman, in private, pray without any clothing? Could a woman wear athletic shorts and a sports bra? Could she wear a burqa? This is entirely left up to her and her only.\nThe clothes worn for prayer must be clean.",

You could be on the finest marble and it is acceptable if it is clean. Once again, the idea is for prayer to be accessible and focused on the spirit, not the material.",

Baha’u’llah has abrogated this and says we only need to say, ““Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.”\nThe verse is a great reminder in times of fear and distress. Sometimes in the greatness of human potential, nature offers humbling and dangerous experiences. Being able to remember that whatever we are experiencing, no matter how great or awe-inspiring it seems, it is not as great as God. God is the Lord of what we observed and the Lord of what we have not yet observed. Hopefully these words can provide solace in those times of exceptional natural phenomena, the signs of God.",

I interpret this as a cross-legged position common to many religions, but you may have another way to sit which demonstrates reverence. While seated, say “Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty” 18 times. This totals to 19 repetitions of Glory.\nIt should be noted that after the Kitab-i-Aqdas was released, the obligatory prayer had changed to include the short prayer.

In the West, there are different definitions for homicide and murder, along with defining intention. In the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha’u’llah uses the Arabic word “al-qatl” (القتل), where upon the various types of murder add onto the base word qatl.\nThis means any loss of human life by another human is prohibited, whether intended or not. The impact of any loss of life by another person is too great. It weakens the fabric of the community, causes trauma, distrust, and potentially thoughts and feelings which can betray which God desires for us.\nIn another sense, it is an act of shirk, the Arabic concept of joining partners with God. Ultimately God has all power of creation, but murder is where a person tries to take this power away from God. The person is deciding when another’s spiritual journey will begin the next stage.\nThe punishment for the intentional act of murder is death, with the option for life imprisonment.\n\n\n19.7.2 Injuries to the Head and Body\nProhibited to assault anyone and cause injuries to the head and body. This includes intentional acts but could possibly also include unintentional acts, such as accidents or from gross negligence.\n\n\n19.7.3 Retaliation\nDo not object to another, nor take one life for another.",

    "text": "19.9 Sexual Acts\n\n19.9.1 Adultery\nAdultery is prohibited. This prohibition does not necessarily mean all kinds of sexual acts are forbidden, despite being based on the Arabic word zina. Adultery is when a married person consents to sexual acts with a person who is not their spouse. Adultery can also include when a non-married person consents to sexual acts with a person they know is married.\nThere are many reasons why adultery is prohibited. The first one is that marriage is usually considered a promise to God and is a sacred union. Violating this promise also signifies a broken promise to God. Perhaps the most important reason is the impact it can have upon the family. Within marriage, negative actions spouses take against each other have negative consequences for the children of the spouses. Adultery can break the bonds of affection for the married couple and betray their mutual ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and healthy environment for children to grow up in.\nAdultery is punishable by the House of Justice. For the 1st offense, 9 mithqáls of gold is to be paid to the House of Justice. This is paid by the man and also paid by the woman. For the 2nd offense, the fine is doubled to 18 mithqáls. To understand the valuation, the box below can show the current value of gold. 9 mithqáls is approximately 38.25g, so you would take the value of gold per gram and multiply it by 38.25, according to the currency you use. The default is US Dollars.\n\n\nThe third offence is subjected to a humiliating punishment. The specifics of this has not been clarified, but could be done so by a House of Justice if needed. Baha’u’llah says any person afflicted by sin should repent, although this does not necessarily absolve the person from being punished by the House of Justice.\n\n\n19.9.2 Lewdness",

    "text": "19.10 Social Acts\n\n19.10.1 Backbiting\nBackbiting is prohibited. Backbiting is speaking about the negative traits and actions of another person without the person being present. What is being discussed can be true, but the person does not have an ability to defend themselves or contribute what they also believe is true.\nAdditionally, Baha’u’llah regularly taught us to refrain from discussing the sins of others, because we are also sinners. This prohibition does not mean a person cannot discuss truthful facts with the person present, but there must be a greater purpose. For example, the previous prohibition regarding all forms of murder. Say you observed a community member dumping something unknown into a river used for drinking water. Another in the community becomes ill and dies due to a toxic substance in the water. Backbiting would be telling others you saw the person dumping toxic chemicals into the water, and the person is not there. The person is unable to say what they put into the river, why, or anything else. The person observed could be at risk of retributive actions, which again puts the greater community at risk of non-spiritual perspectives and actions. Instead, the person should go to the person in question and say “I saw you put some substance into the river. What was it?” The response is up to the truthfulness of who was being asked, but it could keep someone from being falsely accused.\nThe backbiter could have gotten someone accused of murder, or viewed by community members as someone capable of murder even if they are found not guilty. This harm exists in even less obviously impactful situations.\nNow, if there is an investigation into the cause of death, it is not prohibited to provide facts. Honestly state what you observed, without adding assumptions.\nFinally, backbiting also has a perspective of a person being more consumed with the faults of others while lacking the ability to see the faults in themselves. With the People of Glory being told to bring themselves to account each day, we can see Baha’u’llah is very concerned with how we view ourselves and others. Do we have empathy? Do we act with love?\n\n\n19.10.2 Slander\nSlander is prohibited. Slander is the knowingly false negative information about another. Slander is purposefully designed to degrade another’s reputation and can also cause substantial harm to the victim. The impacts of this can lead to lower earnings potential, ruined personal and professional relationships, and less ability to sincerely be positive contributors to their community. It would be difficult to have a healthy assembly of the People of Glory if members are being subjected to backbiting and slander.\n\n\n19.10.3 Do Not Cause Corruption\n\n\n19.10.4 Do Not Cause Enmity\n\n\n19.10.5 Reconcile Differences\n\n\n19.10.6 Do Not Boast Over Another",

    "text": "20.2 Marriage\nMarriage is enjoined upon us. Enjoined is an authoritative instruction or directive which implies it is either required or highly encouraged. The same word is used regarding prayer and fasting, which is usually interpreted to mean as they are required, pending acceptable exceptions.\n\n20.2.1 Purpose of Marriage\nThe purpose of marriage is to have at least one child, a child who will remember God.\n\n\n20.2.2 Monogamy or Bigamy\nThe man is allowed up to two wives. More than two wives is not allowed. The man who is content with one wife with ensure both of their tranquility. This implies there can be complicating issues with polygamy. The first ones I can think of could be jealousy or a fear from the wife that perhaps she is not good enough to completely satisfy her husband. Insecurity definitely impacts tranquility. This means monogamy is preferred, although it is not required.\nThere is no rule which explicitly expresses a limitation on the number of husbands she can have. However, in regards to the teachings Baha’u’llah offers in his letters to Shiraz, he unequivacally states women are equal to men. Perhaps then, this is also applies to marriage law although there is no evidence a Baha’i woman ever married two men in the time of Baha’u’llah. This could merely be a function of Baha’is being subjected to Islamic law, which had a clear prohibition of female polygamy.\n\n\n20.2.3 Consent of Both Partners and Parents\nBoth the man and woman must consent to marriage. Neither can be forced to marry against their wishes. Also, marriage requires the person of all parents of both the bride and the groom. Baha’u’llah says it is to prevent discord or resentment among may arise the couple.\nThis also does not mean there must be arranged marriages.\nHe also says there are other purposes.\n\n\n20.2.4 Virginity\nThe husband is allowed to choose a virgin, but it is not a requirement. The implication of this verse is there is no punishment for the woman if she is not a virgin.\n\n\n20.2.5 Dowry\nA marriage cannot be consummated without the payment of a dowry by the groom to the bride. If the couple lives in the city, the dowry is based on 19 mithqáls (92.34) of gold. If they are in a village, 19 mithqáls of silver. The groom can give up to 95 mithqáls, but is not allowed to exceed it.\n\n20.2.5.1 Gold\n\n\n\n\n20.2.5.2 Silver\n\n\nThere isn’t anything specified if one person lives in a city and the other in a village. My initial feeling is it is based on the groom’s location or potentially where the married couple intends on living together once married.\nDowry is intended to be a gift which demonstrates the seriousness and sincerity of the man towards the woman. It can also help provide a safety net in case of some unexpected event or hardship for the woman.\n\n\n\n20.2.6 Travel and Abandonment\nThe following discusses the husband’s role and will be framed in that context. However, this should also be able to apply if the spousal roles within the particular marriage are reversed, given the equality of men and women.\nThe husband is allowed to travel away from home. He must tell his wife how long he will be gone. If he returns and fulfills his promise, he is considered among the righteous.\nIf he is unable to return at the original specified time and has a genuine reason, he must inform his wife and make every effort to return at the newly specified time. He only has one chance. If he does not inform her of the delay, the wife is free to find another husband 9 months after the original return date. If he does not return by the second time, she is also free to find another husband 9 months after. The wife does not have to find a new husband. Baha’u’llah says God loves those who are patient, but this does not imply the woman would be loved less if she found a new husband.\nDuring the 9 month waiting period, if news reaches her about her husband, she can choose to continue her marriage. She is not required to. God prefers reconciliation, but there should also be no actions which cause enmity.\nIf the husband passed away or was murdered, confirmed by a news report or 2 just witnesses, anytime during his travel, she also must wait. This could be 9 months, which can give time to grieve. After this, she may find a new husband if she chooses.\nIf the husband and wife travel together and discord arises between them, the husband must provide the wife with a full year’s allowance and return her to where she departed, such as home. The other option is to entrust her to a trustworthy person and whatever is needed to take her to her destination. It would seem the full year’s allowance is independent of the requirement to get his wife home. Also, it would also seem there would be room for both to consult on what would be best, such as how much is the allowance.\n\n\n20.2.7 Spirit of Joy and Fragrance\nAssociate with each other in a spirit of joy and fragrance. All that will endure are righteous deeds.\n\n\n20.2.8 Oppression and Lewdness\n\n\n20.2.9 Do Not Follow a Tyrannical and Wretched One",

The couple must wait a year after the intention to divorce is expressed, with the hope the fragrance of love may emanate between them. At the end of the year, if no such fragrance emerged, then divorce is allowed. This also means if the married couple had sex in any form during the year, divorce is not allowed. The husband and wife must be consistent in their intentions.\nAn allowance will be given to the wife if there is no proven misconduct. The allowance is for the entire year.\nIf the two divorce, they do have the option to reconcile within one month if neither has married. Baha’u’llah emphasizes mutual love and consent. If the woman has a new husband, a new union is required to restore the relationship. This could mean the original husband would need to go through the original steps to marry, such as having the consent of both sets of parents, the payment of dowry, and a completely new marriage. On the woman’s side, it only expresses love and consent, without an explicit requirement to be divorced or unmarried.\n\n\n20.3.2 Divorce for Misconduct\nIf the wife is divorced for proven misconduct, she will not have any allowance during the waiting period.",

    "text": "21.8 The Spiritual Aspect of Inheritance\nThroughout the verses regarding inheritance, Baha’u’llah reminds us that God is bountiful and merciful. No matter the amount of inheritance provided, any person who receives some should be grateful for the bounty provided. There are no exceptions based upon judgments of character or other qualifications to receive. This ensures there is no vying for an increased portion, or any attempts to deny another their portion. This should reduce inter-family conflict over the estates of the deceased.\nThere is no distribution for random non-profit causes. However, there are possibilities where the House of Justice will receive a portion of the inheritance. With these portions, the House of Justice is to act as trustees for the benefit of orphans, widows, and the general benefit of others. With this in mind, there is an opportunity, such as in the case of a financially successful person to bestow upon certain demographics a substantial bounty. Orphans are pre-maturity people without parents. They generally reach maturity without anything in their name. The inheritance law can change this if the House of Justice acts according to Baha’u’llah’s command. Those acting as trustees have an important function in ensuring the loss of a beloved’s life is beneficial for the community.",

This\nThey should also consult on the welfare of the servants, those who do believe in God and Baha’u’llah.

    "text": "Verses 1-10\n1 The first thing that God has prescribed for His servants is the recognition of the dawning place of His Revelation and the source of His command, which is the station of His own Self in the realm of command and creation. Whoever attains this has attained all good, and whoever is deprived of it is indeed among the people of error, even if he performs every good deed. If you attain this exalted station and this supreme horizon, every soul must follow what has been commanded by the Desired One, for both are inseparable, one cannot be accepted without the other. This is what the Source of Inspiration has decreed.\n2 Indeed, those who have been endowed with insight from God see the ordinances of God as the greatest means for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And those who are heedless of this are like the ignorant masses. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what has been decreed by the Supreme Pen. It is the spirit of life for those in existence. The seas of wisdom and eloquence have surged forth with the stirring breeze of the All-Merciful. Seize this opportunity, O possessors of intellect. Those who have violated the covenant of God concerning His commands and have turned back on their heels, they are indeed among the people of error in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted.\n3 O assembly of the earth, know that My commands are the lamps of My care among My servants and the keys of My mercy for My creation. Thus has the command been revealed from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Lord of all religions. If anyone were to taste the sweetness of the utterance that has appeared from the mouth of the will of the All-Merciful, he would spend all that he possesses, even if it be the treasures of the entire earth, to uphold one of His commands which have dawned from the horizon of care and grace.\n4 Say, from My laws the fragrance of My garment is diffused, and through them the banners of victory are hoisted on the hills and heights. The tongue of My power has spoken in the dominion of My greatness, addressing My creation: “Carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.” Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner. By My life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of grace will circle around My commands which have shone forth from the horizon of creativity.\n5 Do not think that We have merely revealed to you the laws; rather, We have unsealed the choice sealed wine with the fingers of might and power. This is attested by what has been sent down by the Pen of Revelation. Reflect, O possessors of understanding.\n6 It has been enjoined upon you to perform the prayer consisting of nine rak’ahs to God, the Revealer of the verses, at noon, in the morning, and in the evening. We have pardoned other numbers as a command in the Book of God. Indeed, it is the mighty, chosen command. When you wish to perform the prayer, turn your faces toward My most holy direction, the sacred spot which God has made the focal point for the celestial concourse and the point of adoration for the people of the cities of eternity, the source of command for those in the heavens and the earth. And at the setting of the Sun of Truth and Explanation, the place We have appointed for you, indeed, it is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n7 Everything is realized by His decisive command when the Sun of ordinances rises from the horizon of explanation. All are to follow it, even if it be a command that rends asunder the hearts of the adherents of religions. He does as He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. Whatever the Beloved has decreed is beloved and the Possessor of invention. Whoever finds the fragrance of the All-Merciful and recognizes the source of this Revelation will face the arrows with his eyes to uphold the ordinances among the people. Blessed is he who turns and attains the decisive utterance.\n8 We have detailed the prayer in another tablet. Blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded by the Lord of all beings. For the prayer for the dead, God, the Revealer of the verses, has ordained six Takbirs (Allāhu Akbar or God is the Greatest). Whoever possesses the knowledge of recitation may recite what has been revealed before it, and if not, God has pardoned him. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Forgiving.\n9 Hair does not invalidate your prayers, nor do those things that prevent the spirit, such as bones and the like. Wear sable as you wear silk, brocade, and other such materials. It has not been forbidden in the Qur’an, but the learned were mistaken about it. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n10 Prayer and fasting have been enjoined upon you from the age of maturity as a command from God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. For those who are weak due to illness or old age, God has excused them as a grace from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on any clean surface, and we have abrogated the rule regarding the specific limit in the Book. God knows, and you do not know. Whoever cannot find water should repeat five times, “In the Name of God, the Purest, the Purest,” and then proceed with the prayer. This is what the Lord of the worlds has decreed. In lands where nights and days are prolonged, let them pray according to the hours and the timepieces that mark the passage of time. Indeed, He is the Manifest, the Wise.",

    "text": "Verses 11-20\n11 We have excused you from the Prayer of the Signs. When they appear, remember God with greatness and power. He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Say, “Greatness belongs to God, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.”\n12 Individual prayer has been enjoined upon you; the requirement for congregational prayer has been lifted except for the Prayer for the Dead. This is indeed a wise ordinance.\n13 God has excused women from fasting and obligatory prayer during their menstrual periods. Instead, they are to perform ablutions and repeat the phrase “Glory be to God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty” ninety-five times between noon on one day and noon the next. This is what has been decreed in the Book if you are among those who understand.\n14 When traveling, both men and women, upon stopping and resting, can replace each obligatory prayer with a single prostration. During this prostration, recite “Glory be to God, the Lord of Grandeur and Majesty, of Bounty and Grace.” If unable, simply say, “Glory be to God,” for that suffices in truth. Indeed, He is the All-Sufficient, the Everlasting, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\nAfter completing the prostration, sit in the posture of unity and say eighteen times, “Glory be to God, the Lord of Dominion and Sovereignty.” Thus does God elucidate the paths of truth and guidance, all converging to this straight path. Thank God for this immense favor, praise God for this bounty encompassing the heavens and the earth, and remember God for this mercy surpassing all worlds.\n15 Say, God has made the key to the hidden treasure My love, if you only knew. Without the key, it would remain hidden in the eternal past, if you only believed. This is for the dawning place of revelation and the horizon of radiance, through which the horizons are illumined, if you only knew. This is indeed the ordained decree, by which every decreed fate is established.\n16 O Pen of the Most High, say: O assembly of creation, We have ordained for you fasting during a limited number of days, and have made Naw-Rúz a festival for you after its completion. Thus has the Sun of the Bayán shone forth from the horizon of the Book from the presence of the Lord of Origin and Return.\nAnd let the days which exceed the months before the month of fasting be the manifestations of the letter “H” (Ha) among the nights and days. Therefore, they are not confined by the limits of the year and its months. It is incumbent upon the people of Bahá to provide for themselves, their relatives, the poor, and the needy, to exalt, magnify, and glorify their Lord with joy and gladness.\nWhen the days of giving are completed, let them enter the fast. Thus has the Lord of all humankind decreed. There is no blame on travelers, the sick, pregnant women, or nursing mothers; God has excused them as a grace from Him. He is the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.\n17 These are the ordinances of God which have been inscribed by the Pen of the Most High in the scriptures and tablets. Hold fast to the commandments and laws of God, and do not be among those who have clung to their own principles and discarded the principles of God, following mere conjectures and illusions. Refrain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Beware lest your desires prevent you from this bounty that has been decreed in the Book.\n18 For those who believe in God, the Almighty, it is prescribed that they wash their hands and then their face every day, sit facing God, and recite ninety-five times “Alláh-u-Abhá” (God is Most Glorious). Thus has the Creator of the heavens decreed when He established Himself upon the thrones of His names with grandeur and power. Likewise, perform ablutions for the prayer as a command from God, the One, the Chosen.\n19 Murder, adultery, backbiting, and slander have been forbidden to you. Avoid what you have been prohibited from in the scriptures and tablets.\n20 God has apportioned inheritances according to the number of the letter Z, with shares for your descendants calculated from the Book of Ṭ according to the number of M, Q, and T. For spouses, the share is from the Book of Ḥ according to the number of T and F. For fathers, the share is from the Book of Z according to the number of T and K. For mothers, the share is from the Book of W according to the number of R, F, Y, and Ayn. For brothers, the share is from the Book of H according to the number of Sh. For sisters, the share is from the Book of D according to the number of R and M. For teachers, the share is from the Book of J according to the number of Q and F. This is decreed by the Herald who remembers Me in the nights and early mornings. When We heard the clamor of descendants in the loins, We doubled their share and reduced the others’ share; indeed, He is the All-Powerful, doing what He wills with His authority as He pleases.",

If no such relatives exist, all the estate goes to the House of Justice to be used as God commands; He is the All-Powerful, the Ruler.\n24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God’s command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.\n25 The inhabited house and specific garments are for the male descendants, not the females or other heirs; He is the Bestower, the Bountiful.\n26 If someone dies during their parent’s lifetime, their descendants inherit what would have gone to them, divided justly among them. Thus, the sea of speech has surged, casting forth pearls of laws from the Lord of all beings.\n27 If there are weak descendants, appoint a trustee to manage their inheritance until they reach maturity, or invest it for them. Assign a rightful share of the profits to the trustee for their efforts.\n28 All this is after the payment of God’s right, debts, and funeral expenses, carried out with dignity and honor, as decreed by the Lord of Origin and Return.\n29 Say, this is the hidden knowledge that will never change, for it began with the letter Ṭ indicating the hidden, manifest, invincible Name. This allotment to descendants is a bounty from God for them to thank their Merciful, Compassionate Lord. These are the boundaries of God; do not transgress them with your desires. Follow what you have been commanded by the Source of Revelation. The sincere see God’s ordinances as the water of life for the faithful and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on earth and in the heavens.\n30 God has ordained that in every city a House of Justice should be established, where individuals shall gather in the number of Bahá (9), or more if desired. They should regard themselves as entering the presence of the Exalted One, observing the unseen. These members must be the trusted ones of the Merciful among people and the representatives of God for all who dwell on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants of God for His sake, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is best. Thus has your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving, decreed. Beware not to neglect what is explicitly stated in the Tablet. Fear God, O people of insight.",

    "text": "Verses 31-40\n31 O assembly of creation, build houses in the best possible manner in the name of the Lord of religions in every land, and adorn them with what is befitting, not with pictures and images. Then, remember your Lord, the Merciful, with spirit and fragrance. It is through His remembrance that hearts are illumined and eyes are comforted.\n32 God has ordained for those of you who are able, to make the pilgrimage to the House, but has excused women from this obligation out of His mercy. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Generous.\n33 O people of Bahá, it is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, trades, and the like. We have made your engagement in such work equivalent to the worship of God, the True One. Reflect, O people, on the mercy and favors of God, and then thank Him in the evening and at dawn. Do not waste your time in idleness and sloth; engage in activities that benefit yourselves and others. Thus has the matter been decreed in this Tablet, from whose horizon the sun of wisdom and explanation has shone forth. The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idle and seek sustenance. Hold firmly to the rope of means, putting your trust in God, the Provider of all means.\n34 God has forbidden you from kissing hands in the Book; this is what you have been prohibited from by your Mighty, All-Powerful Lord. No one is permitted to seek forgiveness from another. Turn to God in repentance yourselves. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving.\n35 O servants of the Merciful, arise to serve the Cause in such a way that the sorrows of those who disbelieve in the Source of the verses do not overcome you. When the promise was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, people differed and each group held onto their own conjectures and illusions.\n36 Some people sit at the back, seeking prestige, and others claim hidden knowledge and esoteric understanding. Say, O heedless deceiver, who are you? And to those who claim deep inner knowledge, say, O liar, by God, what you possess is mere husks, left for you as bones are left for dogs. By the True One, if someone were to wash the feet of the world, worship God in the wilderness, forests, mountains, and heights, and near every stone, tree, and dust, yet not exude the fragrance of My approval, it would never be accepted. This is the judgment of the Lord of all beings.\nMany have secluded themselves on the islands of India, denied themselves what God has permitted, borne ascetic hardships, yet are not remembered by God, the Revealer of the verses. Do not make actions the partner of hopes, nor deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the eternal past. Say, the spirit of deeds is My approval; everything is tied to My acceptance. Read the Tablets to know what is intended in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Whoever wins My love has the right to sit on the throne of gold in the highest place, and whoever is denied it, even if they sit on the dust, they seek refuge from it to God, the Lord of religions.\n37 Whoever claims a matter before the completion of a full thousand years is a lying impostor. We ask God to help him to recant if he repents, for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. But if he persists in what he has said, a punishment will be sent upon him from which there is no escape; He is indeed severe in punishment. Whoever interprets or explains this verse in a way other than its evident meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and His mercy, which has preceded all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your own illusions; follow what your Almighty, Wise Lord commands you. Soon, there will arise clamor from most lands. Avoid it, O people, and do not follow every wicked, contemptible one. This is what We have informed you of when We were in Iraq, in the land of mystery, and in this luminous spot.\n38 O people of the earth, when the sun of My beauty sets and the heaven of My body is concealed, do not be troubled. Arise to assist My Cause and to exalt My word among the people of the world. We are with you in all conditions and will aid you with the truth. We have always been able to do so. Whoever recognizes Me will arise to serve Me with a steadfastness that even the hosts of the heavens and the earth cannot deter.\n39 People are asleep; if they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts toward God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and cast aside all that they possess, even if it were all the treasures of the world, so that their Lord might remind them with a word from Himself. Thus, He informs you of what is hidden, through a Tablet that reveals what has appeared in existence, a knowledge that none has attained except His own Self, who reigns over all the worlds. The intoxication of desire has seized them to such an extent that they do not see the Lord of all creation, whose call has been raised from every direction: There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise.\n40 Say: Rejoice not in that which you possess, for in the morning it shall belong to another. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed counsel you. Say: Have you found permanence in that which you possess, or fidelity? No, by Myself, the Most Merciful, if you are among the fair-minded. The days of your life pass as the winds blow, and your glory will be rolled up as was the glory of those before you. Reflect, O people, where are your past days, and where are your vanished years? Blessed are the days that were spent in the remembrance of God, and the hours devoted to His praise, the All-Wise. By My life, the glory of the exalted shall not endure, nor the ornaments of the wealthy, nor the power of the wicked. All shall perish by a single word from Him. Indeed, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. What people possess will not benefit them, and what would benefit them, they have neglected. They will awaken, but will find nothing of what they have missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If they knew, they would spend all they possess to have their names remembered before the Throne, but they are among the dead.",

Abandon your illusions and turn toward God, your ancient Lord.\n42 The endowments dedicated to charitable purposes have been returned to God, the Manifestation of the Signs. No one is permitted to administer them except with the permission of the Source of Revelation. After Him, the authority is passed to the Aghsán (the branches, referring to Bahá’u’lláh’s descendants), and after them, to the House of Justice, should it be established in the land. They are to use these endowments in elevated places for this Cause and for whatever they are commanded by the Mighty, the Powerful One.

Upon a third offense, a mark should be placed on the thief’s forehead so that they may be recognized and not accepted in the cities and lands of God. Beware that compassion does not prevent you from carrying out the laws of God. Act according to what you have been commanded by a compassionate and merciful Lord. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and laws for your own protection and the elevation of your station, just as parents nurture their children. By My life, if you knew what We intended for you with Our sacred commandments, you would sacrifice your lives for this holy, exalted, and mighty Cause.\n46 Whoever wishes to use vessels of gold and silver, there is no harm in it. However, beware lest your hands immerse into dishes and plates without grace; take what is closest to refinement. He desires to see you adorned with the manners of the people of Paradise in His supreme, invincible dominion. Uphold refinement in all matters so that eyes do not fall upon what is displeasing to your souls and to the inhabitants of Paradise. Whoever disregards this, his action is nullified immediately; but if he has a valid excuse, God will forgive him. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Generous.\n47 There is no partner for the Source of the Cause in the greatest infallibility; He is the Manifestation who does what He wills in the Kingdom of creation. God has reserved this station for Himself, and no one else has been given a share in this mighty, exalted matter. This is the decree of God, which was hidden behind the veils of mystery. We have revealed it in this manifestation, and with it, We have torn the veil of those who did not understand the decree of the Book and were among the heedless.\n48 It is enjoined upon every father to educate his son and daughter in learning and writing, and also in what has been prescribed in the Tablet. If he fails to do so, the trustees are to take from him whatever is necessary for their education, provided he is wealthy. Otherwise, the matter is to be referred to the House of Justice. We have made it a refuge for the poor and needy. Whoever educates his son, or any child, it is as though he has educated one of My own children. Upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness, and My mercy that has preceded the worlds.\n49 God has decreed that for every man and woman who commits adultery, a fine must be paid to the House of Justice, amounting to nine mithqáls of gold. If they repeat the offense, the penalty is doubled. This is the decree of the Lord of Names for the first and second offenses. For a third offense, they are subjected to a humiliating punishment. Whoever is afflicted by sin should repent and turn back to God. He forgives whom He wills and is not questioned about what He wills, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n50 Beware lest the splendors of majesty prevent you from the pure and flowing waters of this clear stream. Take the cups of prosperity in this morning in the name of the Creator of the dawn, and then drink with the remembrance of His mighty and wondrous Name.",

    "text": "Verses 51-60\n51 We have permitted you to listen to music and melodies. However, beware that your listening does not lead you away from the path of dignity and reverence. Rejoice in the joy of My Greatest Name, by which hearts are enraptured and the minds of the near ones are attracted. We have made it a ladder for the ascent of souls to the highest horizon. Do not make it the wings of self and desire. I seek refuge in God that you may not be among the ignorant.\n52 We have allocated one-third of all blood money (diyah) to the Seat of Justice, and We counsel its members to dispense it with absolute justice, to spend what has accumulated with them on what they have been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O men of justice, be shepherds of the sheep of God in His dominion, and protect them from the wolves who have appeared in garments, just as you would protect your own children. Thus does the trustworthy Counselor advise you.\n53 If you differ on any matter, refer it to God as long as the sun is shining from this heaven. And when it sets, refer to what has been revealed from Him, for it is sufficient for the peoples of the world.\nSay: O people, do not let turmoil overtake you if the kingdom of My manifestation disappears and the waves of the sea of My utterance become still. In My appearance, there is wisdom, and in My concealment, there is another wisdom known only to God, the One, the All-Knowing. We behold you from Our most glorious horizon, and We shall aid anyone who rises to assist My Cause with the hosts of the celestial realm and a company of the nearest angels.\n54 O people of the earth! By the truth of God, rivers of fresh and pure water have gushed forth from the stones due to the sweetness of the utterance of your Lord, the Chosen One, yet you remain heedless. Abandon what you possess and soar with the wings of detachment above the realm of creation. Thus does the Lord of innovation command you, He who, with the movement of His Pen, has turned the worlds upside down.\n55 Do you know from which horizon your most glorious Lord calls you? And have you realized by which Pen your Lord, the Possessor of all names, commands you? No, by My life! If you knew, you would abandon the world, turning with your hearts towards the Beloved, and the vibration of the Word would seize you in such a manner that the greater world would tremble, let alone this lesser world. Thus, from the heaven of My bounty, the showers of My grace have poured down as a favor from Me, so that you may be among the thankful.\n56 As for injuries to the head and body, their rulings vary according to their severity, and the Judge (or the All-Knowing One) has prescribed a specific compensation (diyah) for each level. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the Exalted Judge. If We so wish, We could detail them with justice, as a promise from Us. Verily, He is the Fulfiller, the Most High.\n57 Hospitality has been prescribed for you once each month, even if it is only with water. God has desired to bring hearts together, even through the means of heaven and earth.\n58 Beware lest the affairs of the self and desire cause division among you. Be like the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body. Thus does the Pen of Revelation counsel you, if you are of those who believe with certainty.\n59 Behold the mercy and grace of God. He commands you that which benefits you, though He is independent of all the worlds. Your evil deeds do not harm Us, just as your good deeds do not benefit Us. We call you only for the sake of God; this is witnessed by every discerning, clear-sighted one.\n60 If you send out hunting animals to catch prey, mention the name of God, and what they catch for you is permissible, even if you find it dead. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware that you do not act excessively in this matter. Be on the path of justice and fairness in all things. Thus does the Source of Revelation command you, if you are among those who understand.",

    "text": "Verses 61-70\n61 God has commanded you to show love and kindness to your kindred, but He has not ordained for them any right to the wealth of the people. Indeed, He is the One Who is independent of all the worlds.\n62 Whoever deliberately burns a house, burn him; and whoever intentionally kills a person, kill him. Take the laws of God with the hands of power and might, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. However, if you decide to imprison them for life, there is no harm in this according to the Book. Indeed, He is the Judge over what He wills.\n63 God has enjoined upon you marriage. Beware that you do not exceed two wives. He who is content with one maid will ensure his own tranquility and hers as well. There is no harm for the one who chooses a virgin for his service. Thus has the matter been recorded by the Pen of Revelation in truth. Marry, O people, so that there may appear from you those who will remember Me among My servants. This is My commandment to you; take it as an aid for yourselves.\n64 O people of creation! Do not follow your own selves, for they incite to oppression and lewdness. Follow the Lord of all things, who commands you to righteousness and piety. Indeed, He is independent of all the worlds. Beware that you do not corrupt the earth after it has been reformed, and whoever causes corruption is not of Us, and We are clear of him. Thus has the matter been revealed from the heaven of Revelation in truth.\n65 It has been stipulated in the Bayán that marriage should be by the consent of both parties. However, We, desiring love, affection, and unity among the servants, have attached it to the permission of the parents, that no discord or resentment may arise between them. We have other purposes in this as well. Thus has the matter been decreed.\n66 Marriage is not consummated without the payment of a dowry. It has been ordained that in the cities, the dowry shall be nineteen mithqáls of pure gold, and in the villages, silver. Whoever wishes to give more is forbidden to exceed ninety-five mithqáls. Thus has the matter been inscribed with glory. He who is content with the first option is better off, according to the Book. God enriches whom He wills through the means of heaven and earth, and God has power over all things.\n67 God has ordained that any servant who wishes to leave his homeland must set a specific time with his spouse for his return, in whatever duration he desires. If he returns and fulfills his promise, he has followed the command of his Lord and is among the righteous, as recorded by the Pen of Command. However, if he has a genuine excuse, he should inform his wife and make every effort to return to her. If neither of these conditions is met, she is to wait for a period of nine months. After the completion of this period, she is free to choose another husband, but if she chooses to remain patient, God loves those who are patient.\nFollow My commandments and do not follow every polytheist who has been sinful in the Book. If news of the husband reaches her during her waiting period, she may resume the marriage if she so desires, for God seeks to reconcile matters between His servants. Beware of engaging in actions that create enmity between you, for thus has the matter been decreed, and the promise fulfilled.\nIf news of the husband’s death or murder reaches her, confirmed by widespread report or by two just witnesses, she is to remain in the house for a specified period. After this time has passed, she is free to make her own choice in what she wishes. This is the command issued by the One who is firm in His decree.\n68 If discord or aversion arises between them, the husband is not permitted to divorce her immediately. Instead, he is to be patient for a full year, hoping that the fragrance of love may once again emanate between them. If, at the end of the year, no such fragrance has emerged, then divorce is permissible, for God is wise in all things. God has forbidden you from divorcing more than three times, as a bounty from Him, so that you may be among the grateful. This has been inscribed in the Tablet by the Pen of Command. The one who divorces has the option to reconcile within one month with mutual love and consent, as long as she has not taken another husband. If she has, the separation becomes final, and a new union is required to restore the relationship. Thus has the matter been decreed by the Source of Beauty in the Tablet of Glory, inscribed with honor.\n69 “And if a man travels and his wife travels with him, and then discord arises between them, he must provide her with a full year’s allowance and return her to the place from which she departed, or entrust her to the care of a trustworthy person along with what she needs for the journey to take her to her destination. Verily, your Lord decrees as He wills, with a power that encompasses all things.”\n70 “And the one who is divorced for proven misconduct shall have no allowance during her waiting period. Thus has the Orb of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of justice. Verily, God loves unity and concord and abhors separation and divorce. Associate, O people, with each other in the spirit of joy and fragrance. By My life! All that exists shall perish, and what will endure is righteous deeds. God is witness to what I say. O My servants! Reconcile your differences and then heed the counsel of the Most Exalted Pen. Do not follow a tyrannical and wretched one.”",

    "text": "Verses 71-80\n71 Beware lest the world deceive you as it has deceived those before you. Follow the limits and laws of God, and then walk this path which has been extended in truth. Verily, those who abandon oppression and wrongdoing and embrace piety, they are among the best of creation in the sight of God. The hosts of the celestial realm and those who dwell in this station, exalted in the name of God, remember them.\n72 It has been forbidden to sell maidservants and servants. No one is permitted to buy a servant, as decreed in the Tablet of God. Thus the matter has been inscribed by the Pen of Justice with grace. No one should boast over another, for all are servants and signs that there is no God but Him. He has been wise in all things.\n73 Adorn yourselves with the ornament of deeds, for whoever has succeeded in acting to attain His good pleasure is indeed among the people of glory and is remembered at the Throne. Support the Lord of Creation through good deeds, and then through wisdom and eloquence. Thus have you been commanded in most of the Tablets by the All-Merciful, for He is fully aware of what I say. Let no one object to another, nor take one life for another. This is what you have been forbidden in the Book, veiled in the pavilion of might. Will you kill whom God has brought to life with a spirit from Him? This is a grievous wrong in the sight of the Throne. Fear God, and do not destroy what God has built with the hands of oppression and tyranny. Then take the path to the Truth. When the armies of knowledge appeared with the banners of expression, the tribes of religions were vanquished, except for those who desired to drink from the Kawthar of life in a paradise that came from the essence of the Exalted One.\n74 God has decreed purity for the water of semen as a mercy from Him to humanity. Thank Him with joy and spiritual fragrance, and do not follow those who are far from the Source of closeness. Rise up to serve the Cause in all conditions, for He strengthens you with a power that encompasses the world. Hold fast to the cord of cleanliness so that no traces of dirt are seen on your garments. This is the decree of the One who is more subtle than all subtlety. And for those who have an excuse, there is no blame upon them; He is indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful. Purify every disliked thing with water that has not changed in its essential properties. Beware of using water that has been altered by air or any other substance. Be an element of refinement among humanity. This is what your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, has willed for you.\n75 And likewise, God has removed the law of impurity from all things and from other religions as a gift from God. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. All things have been immersed in the ocean of purity from the first day of Ridván, when We manifested to those in existence with Our most beautiful names and highest attributes. This is from My bounty which has encompassed the worlds, so that you may associate with the followers of other religions and proclaim the Cause of your Lord, the Merciful. This is the crown of deeds, if you are among those who know.\n76 And He has decreed the utmost refinement and the washing of what has been covered by dust, and how much more so of encrusted dirt and filth beneath it. Fear God and be among the purified. The one who sees dirt on his garment, his prayer does not ascend to God, and the hosts on high distance themselves from him. Use rosewater, then pure perfume; this is what God has loved from the beginning that has no beginning, so that there may exude from you the fragrance your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, has desired.\n77 God has forgiven you what was revealed in the Bayán regarding the obliteration of books, and has permitted you to read from sciences that benefit you, not those that lead to disputes in words. This is better for you if you are of those who understand.\n78 O assembly of kings! The Sovereign has come, and the kingdom belongs to God, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Ever-Abiding. Worship none but God and turn with radiant hearts toward the countenance of your Lord, the Lord of Names. This is a command that surpasses whatever you possess, if you but knew.\n79 Indeed, We see you rejoice in what you have gathered for others and deprive yourselves of the worlds that none but the Preserved Tablet can reckon. Wealth has occupied you from the ultimate end—this is not befitting for you, if you but knew. Purify your hearts from the stench of the world, hastening toward the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, by whom the earthquakes appeared and the tribes lamented, except for those who cast aside the world and took what was commanded in the Hidden Tablet.\n80 This is the Day on which Moses attained the lights of the Ancient One and drank the pure waters of reunion from this cup, by which the seas were set aflame. Say: By the truth of God, Mount Sinai circles around the Source of the Revelation, and the Spirit calls from the Kingdom: “Come, O sons of vanity!” This is the Day on which the hosts of God hastened in longing to meet Him, and Zion cried out: “The promise has been fulfilled, and that which was written in the Tablets of God, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Beloved, has appeared.”",

By Him, the Hour has come, and the moon has been cleft asunder, and every irrevocable matter has been clearly distinguished.\n82 O assembly of kings! You are but vassals; the Sovereign has appeared in the most glorious attire and calls you to His own Self, the All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding. Beware lest pride prevent you from the Day-Spring of Revelation, or the world veil you from the Creator of the heavens. Rise to serve the Purpose for which you were created by a word from Him, and He has made you manifestations of power over what has been and what will be.\n83 By God, We do not desire to rule over your kingdoms; rather, We have come to rule over hearts, for they are the place of Bahá’s vision. The Kingdom of Names bears witness to this, if only you understood. Whoever follows his Lord has turned away from the entire world—how much more from this glorious station! Leave your houses and turn toward the Kingdom; this will benefit you in both this world and the next. The Sovereign of Power bears witness to this, if only you knew.\n84 Blessed is the king who arises to support My Cause in My kingdom and detaches himself from all else. He is one of the people of the Crimson Ark, which God has made for the people of Bahá. It is fitting for everyone to honor, revere, and assist him, that he may conquer cities with the keys of My Name, the One Who rules over all in the realms of the unseen and the seen. He is as the sight of mankind, the most radiant crown upon the brow of creation, and the head of generosity for the body of the world. Support him, O people of Bahá, with wealth and lives.\n85 O King of Austria! The Dawning-Place of the Light of Divine Unity was in the prison of ’Akká when you visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque. You passed by and did not inquire about Him, even though with Him every house was exalted and every lofty gate was opened. We made Him the Object of the world’s direction for My remembrance, yet you rejected the One remembered when He appeared with the Kingdom of God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We were with you in all conditions and found you clinging to the branch, heedless of the root. Your Lord bears witness to what I say. Our hearts were grieved as We saw you turning to My name but unaware of Me before your face. Open your eyes that you may behold this noble scene and recognize the One you call upon in the nights and days, and see the light shining from this radiant horizon.\n86 Say: O King of Berlin! Hear the call from this manifest Temple: There is no God but Me, the Everlasting, the Ancient. Let not pride veil you from the Dawn of Revelation, nor desire hinder you from the Lord of the Throne and of earth. Thus does the Most Exalted Pen counsel you, for He is the Gracious, the Generous. Recall one greater than you in station and mightier than you in rank; where is he now, and what does he possess? Be alert and do not be among the heedless. He cast behind him the Tablet of God when We informed him of the armies of the oppressors that had come against Us. Thus, humiliation overtook him from all sides until he returned to dust in great loss. O King, reflect on him and on others like him who dominated the lands and ruled over the people. The Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Take heed and be among those who remember.\n87 We desire nothing from you; We only counsel you for the sake of God, and We endure with patience that which has befallen Us from you, O assembly of kings.\n88 O Kings of America and Presidents of the Republics therein! Hearken to that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity: There is no God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the Generous. Adorn the temple of dominion with the raiment of justice and piety, and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus does the Dawning-Place of Names command you, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. The Promised One has appeared in this glorious station, by which the lips of existence have smiled in the seen and unseen. Seize the Day of God, for meeting Him is better for you than all that the sun shines upon, if you are of those who understand.\nO assembly of rulers! Hear the call that has been raised from the Dawning-Place of Grandeur: There is no God but Me, the Speaker, the All-Knowing. Heal the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who is whole with the scourge of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the Wise.\n89 O company of Rome! We hear among you the sound of the owl. Has the intoxication of desire seized you, or are you among the heedless? O point situated on the shore of the two seas! The throne of oppression has been established upon you, and the fire of hatred has been ignited within you to such an extent that it has caused lamentation in the Concourse on high and those who circle around the exalted Throne. We see within you the ignorant ruling over the wise, and darkness boasting over the light, while you are in manifest delusion. Your outward adornment has deceived you. By the Lord of creation! It will perish, and the daughters and widows, and the tribes among you, shall weep. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed give you tidings.\n90 O banks of the River Rhine! We have seen you covered with blood, as the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and again you shall have it.\nWe hear the lamentation of Berlin, though she is now in manifest glory.",

If one party enters into the union, it becomes forbidden for the other party to exercise what they possess from their end unless that is reverted after a command has been elevated from what we have made apparent in truth, or what has appeared justly. Before that happens, you should strive to approach it, hoping that by doing so, you elevate the command of Allah. Thus, the leaves rustled on the branches, mentioning their Merciful Lord.

    "text": "Why God Changes the Laws\n140 O assembly of the statements, I swear you by your Lord, the Merciful, to look at what has been revealed in truth with an eye of fairness and not to be among those who see the evidence of God and deny it. Indeed, they are the ones who are ruined. The point of the statement has been clearly articulated in this verse by the elevation of my command before his command. Every fair and knowledgeable person bears witness to that. As you see it today, it has risen to a status that is only denied by those whose vision has been blurred in the past and in the future. For them, there is a humiliating punishment.\n141 Say, “By Allah, indeed I am beloved, and now listen to what descends from the heavens of revelation and lament for what you have committed in its days. Fear Allah, and do not be among the transgressors.\nSay, ’O people, if you do not believe in it, do not oppose it. By Allah, what has gathered against it from the armies of the oppressors is sufficient.”\n142 Indeed, some rules have been revealed so that the Supreme Pen may not move in this revelation except to mention His lofty stations and His most beautiful view. When We wanted to show favor, We detailed it with the truth and lightened what We intended for you. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the Noble.\n143 I have informed you before about what this Wise Reminder speaks. It says, the truthful word, “that it speaks in every matter that ‘there is no god but Me, the Unique, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, the Aware.’”\nThis is a station that God has specifically assigned to this inaccessible, wondrous revelation. This is from the grace of God if you are among those who understand. This is from His definitive command, His greatest name, His highest word, and the rise of His most beautiful names if you are among the knowledgeable ones. Indeed, with it, the sunrises and the easts become visible. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed with truth, and contemplate on it, and do not be among the transgressors.",

This is indeed a matter of wonder. You have taken pride in My name and neglected My essence. When the Merciful came with the argument and the proof, We broke through the veils. Beware of veiling the people with another veil. Break the chains of illusions in the name of the Sovereign of Mankind and do not be among the deceivers. When you turn towards Allah and enter this matter, do not cause corruption therein, nor measure Allah’s book by your desires. This is the advice of Allah before and after. The witnesses of Allah and His chosen ones bear witness to this. Verily, we all are witnesses to it.\n166 Remember the elder who was named Muhammad, before Hassan, and he was among the most knowledgeable scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and his likes turned away from it, and those who separated the wheat from the barley turned to Allah. He, on his claim, wrote down the laws of Allah night and day. But when the Chosen One came, not a letter of it benefited him. If it had benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face which illuminated the faces of the close ones. If you had believed in Allah at the time of His manifestation, people would not have turned away from Him and what you see happening today would not have been reported to us. Fear Allah and do not be among the heedless.\n\n\nDo Not Let Names Deter You From Their Owner\n167 Beware that you do not let names deter you from their Owner, or let remembrance obscure this Wise Remembrance. Seek refuge in Allah, O assembly of scholars, and do not make yourselves a veil between me and my creation. Thus, Allah admonishes you and commands you to be just, lest your deeds become void while you are unaware. The one who turned away from this matter, can he affirm a truth in innovation? No, for he is the Master of invention, but people are in a clear veil. Say, with this, the sun of the proof has risen, and the light of the evidence has appeared to those in the realm. Fear Allah, O people of insight, and do not deny. Beware lest the mention of the Prophet prevent you from this Greater News, or the guardianship prevent the Guardianship of Allah, the Protector over all the worlds.\nEvery name has been created by His word, and every matter is tied to His command, the Executor, the Mighty, the Innovator. Say, this is the Day of Allah, in which only His Dominant Self is mentioned over all the worlds. This matter has disturbed what you have of illusions and images.\n\n\nDon’t Use the Book and Use it as Evidence Against Allah\n168 We see among you those who take the book and use it as evidence against Allah, just as every community used its book as evidence against Allah, the Dominant, the Sustainer. Say, by Allah, the truth is that today, the books of the world and what they contain of scriptures will not benefit you, except for this book which speaks at the axis of creation, affirming that there is no god but I, the All-Knowing, the Wise.\n\n\nUnite People\n169 O assembly of scholars, beware of becoming the cause of disagreement among the masses, just as you were the reason for their turning away at the beginning. Unite the people around this statement by which the pebbles proclaimed ‘the Kingdom belongs to Allah, the source of the signs’. Thus Allah advises you out of His grace. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.\n170 Remember the noble one whom we invited to Allah. Indeed, he was arrogant, following his whims after we sent him the proof that pleased the eye. Thus, Allah’s argument was completed upon everyone in the heavens and the earths. We commanded him to approach with grace from the Rich, the Exalted, but he turned his back until the punishers of torment seized him, by Allah’s justice. Indeed, we were witnesses.\n171 We tore apart the veils so that the inhabitants of the kingdom might hear the sound of their tearing. This is the command of Allah from before and hereafter. Blessed are those who act upon what is commanded, and woe to the neglectful.\n172 We only intended in the realm of sovereignty to manifest God and His authority, and God is sufficient as a witness over me. We only intended in the celestial sphere to elevate the command of God and His praise, and God is sufficient as my guardian. We only intended in the realm of omnipotence to mention God and what descended from Him, and God is sufficient as my helper.",

Then remember when the source of monotheism, the office of abstraction, was desired. Perhaps the free will glimpse the capacity of the needle’s syringe with what is behind the curtains of your Lord’s secrets, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say, indeed, we entered the office of meanings and clarification when those in existence were unaware. We witnessed what the Merciful descended and accepted what He gifted to me from the signs of God, the Guardian, the Everlasting. We heard what He testified in the Tablet. Indeed, we were witnesses. We fulfilled it by a command from us. Indeed, we were commanders.",

    "text": "To the Eloquent Assembly (People of the Bayan)\n176 O eloquent assembly, indeed, we entered the office of God when you were asleep, and we observed the Tablet when you were slumbering. By God, the truth, we read it before its descent while you were unaware. We comprehended the book when you were in the loins. This is my remembrance according to your measure, not according to God’s measure. What is in God’s knowledge testifies to this if you but knew, and the tongue of God testifies to this if you but understood. By God, if the veil were lifted, you would be struck dumb.\n\nBeware Arguing About God\n177 Beware of arguing about God and His command. He has become apparent in such a manner that He encompasses what has been and what will be. If we speak in this place with the tongue of the celestial beings, we would say, God created that office before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and we entered it before the letter “kaf” was combined with its cornerstone, the “nun” [Arabic letters].\nThis is the language of my servants in my kingdom. Reflect on what the tongue of the beings of my dominion speaks, with the knowledge we have taught them from Us, and what was hidden in the knowledge of God, and what the tongue of greatness and power speaks in its praiseworthy position.\n178 This is not a matter to play with your illusions, and this is not a place where every coward and deluded one can enter. By God, this is a track of disclosure and detachment, and a field of observation and elevation. Only the knights of the Merciful, who have discarded their capabilities, can wander here. They are the supporters of God on earth and the sources of power among all the worlds.\n\n\nBeware Allowing What is in the Explanation from Preventing You from you Lord\n179 Beware of allowing what is in the explanation to prevent you from your Merciful Lord. By God, it was indeed sent down for my remembrance if you only knew. The sincere ones find in it nothing but the recognition of my love and my name, the Supreme Witness over all things seen and unseen. Say, O people, turn your attention to what was sent down from my highest pen. If you find in it the knowledge of God, do not object to it and do not prevent yourselves from God’s bounty and His subtleties. Thus, God advises you, for He is indeed the Wise Advisor.\n\n\nAsk God What You Do Not Understand\n180 What you do not understand from the explanation, ask God, your Lord, and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Indeed, if He wills, He can clarify for you what was sent down in it and what was hidden in the sea of His words from the precious jewels of knowledge and wisdom. Indeed, He is the Supreme Authority over the names. There is no god but He, the Supreme Authority, the Sustainer.",

Remember the favor of your Lord when He nurtured you through nights and days for the sake of His cause. Fear God and be among those who repent. Has your matter become unclear to people, is it unclear to yourself as well? Hide from God, then remember when you were standing before the Throne and you wrote what We revealed to you from the signs of God, the Dominant, the Able, the Powerful.\n\nTurn to Him and He Will Forgive You\nBeware that your passion doesn’t prevent you from acknowledging the unity of God. Turn to Him and do not fear your actions, for He forgives whomever He wills out of His grace. There is no god but He, the Forgiving, the Generous. We only advise you for the sake of God. If you accept, it’s for your own benefit, and if you turn away, indeed, your Lord is free from need of you and those who follow you out of clear delusion. God has taken from those who led you astray, so return to Him humbly, submissively, and with utter humility. Indeed, He will erase your misdeeds.
