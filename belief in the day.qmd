## The Day

Moses attained the lights of the Ancient Ones.

Moses drank the pure waters of reunion from this cup, by which the seas were set aflame

Mount Sinai circles around the Source of Revelation.

The Spirit (Jesus Christ) calls from the Kingdom "Come, O sons of vanity!"

Hosts of God hastened in longing to meet Him.

Zion cried out, "The promise has been fulfilled, and that which was written in the Tablets of God, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Beloved, has appeared."

### The Hour

## Fulfillment

By Him (Baha'u'llah) the Hour has come

Moon has been cleft asunder

Every irrevocable matter has been clearly distinguished

## Seize the Day
