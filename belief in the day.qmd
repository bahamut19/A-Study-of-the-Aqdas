## The Day

Moses attained the lights of the Ancient Ones.

Moses drank the pure waters of reunion from this cup, by which the seas were set aflame

Mount Sinai circles around the Source of Revelation.

The Spirit (Jesus Christ) calls from the Kingdom "Come, O sons of vanity!"

Hosts of God hastened in longing to meet Him.

Zion cried out, "The promise has been fulfilled, and that which was written in the Tablets of God, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Beloved, has appeared."

### The Hour

## Fulfillment

The Greatest Announcement

By Him (Baha'u'llah) the Hour has come

Moon has been cleft asunder

Every irrevocable matter has been clearly distinguished

This is the Day of God; none is to be mentioned in it but His own Self, the Sovereign over all that is in the heavens and the earth. This is a Cause by which all that you hold as illusions and forms has been shaken.

## Seize the Day

He (the Bab) said, if you attain what We reveal, you will ask from the grace of God for Him (Baha'u'llah) to reign upon your innermost selves, for that is a glory beyond reach. For Him to drink a cup of water with you is greater than for every soul to drink of His own existence, indeed greater than all things.
