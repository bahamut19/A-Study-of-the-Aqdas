# Intro

What could a community be like if the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha'u'llah is the primary source of guidance? As of this writing, there have been no distinct communities which emphasize the fullness of the Aqdas. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is addressed to all of creation and for the people of Baha.

My goal is to take a loving look in the Aqdas, use Baha'u'llah's teachings to explain and expand upon concepts, and to use whatever inspiration I have access to at least demonstrate the potentials the Aqdas has for you, for me, and for the rest of us who believe in Baha'u'llah.

This book is merely my own personal understanding and perspective, just one way to look at it. Perhaps you may also have your own way as well. I welcome any discussion of this book, the Aqdas, and the building of distanct Aqdas communities. Thank you!
