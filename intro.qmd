Praise be to God, the Creator of and Source of all inspiration, knowledge, and wisdom!

Allah'u'abha!

The Bab and Baha'u'llah, from 1844 to 1892, ushered in a new era for all mankind. The culmination of their revelations, the Bayan by the Bab in 1848, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas by Baha'u'llah in 1873, offer the framework to develop individuals, communities, and nations in a newly spiritual way. The Bayan, which was unfinished prior to the Bab's execution in 1850, was symbolically completed by the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Up until this point in 2026, there have been no English language studies of the entire Kitab-i-Aqdas as a stand-alone entity.

This is because many followers of Baha'u'llah merely view the book as only a book of laws, because it was not translated until over a 100 years after its completion, and because other authors are more preeminent among communities which believe in Baha'u'llah. As such, the Kitab-i-Aqdas is not given the respect it deserves.

This book aims to place the Kitab-i-Aqdas in the exalted position it deserves to be. To do this, we need to understand the Kitab-i-Aqdas is more than a book of laws, it is the framework for God's will, which is to liberate souls, to create distinct spiritual communities, and to bring about unity among the people of the world. The Bayan will be used as a primary supplement, as well as other writings by Baha'u'llah. No other sources will be considered. It is a technique which is rarely used, to use Scripture to explain Scripture.

The Kitab-i-Aqdas makes no claim of starting completely from scratch, to not have any prior origins or inspirations. It also does not deny the reality of the ways of the world in which it was created. The world was already deep into the Industrial Revolution and on the cusp of the Modern age. Some societies were progressing in certain qualities more than others. These societies each brought certain strengths and weaknesses.

What the Kitab-i-Aqdas does is act like a composer of music, taking instruments, notes and chords which already exist, and using them to create an entirely new composition. This composition is entirely unique in itself, but shouldn't be terribly strange to anyone. When listened to in its entirety, you will feel its vibrations within your soul, a soul which does yearn to have a relationship with the divine. This composition is itself a new technique able to create more heavenly compositions, where the compositions are the various organizations of society. This has its place to refine what already exists so that mankind can be prepared, guided, and inspired to continue its progress into perpetual tomorrow, a tomorrow of hope, love, and if so desired, peace.

I make no claim of expertise, divinity, or scholarly prowess. I make no claim where the contents of this book is the only way to interpret the Kitab-i-Aqdas. My perspective is but one perspective and my hope is more authors offer their own perspectives on this magnificent work. The Kitab-i-Aqdas is worthy of scholarship and a place on every bookshelf, coffeetable, and handbag.

This book will be divided into four parts. The first part will be the pillars of belief and will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book. The second part will focus on the relationship we are capable of having with God along with the virtues this relationship develops. The third part will start to explore the practical application of the Kitab-i-Aqdas on our private lives and relationships, outlining a set of rights and responsibilities from birth to maturity. The fourth part will explore leadership in the civil and faith-based spheres, culminating in a unique vision of the future we can all be a part of.

Whether you currently believe in Baha'u'llah or not, I feel the Kitab-i-Aqdas has something to offer for everyone. Liberation is for everyone, to include you and your loved ones. I am grateful you have given this book a chance to be read. Thank you!
