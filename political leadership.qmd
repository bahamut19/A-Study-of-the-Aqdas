title: "Political Leadership"
---

## Introduction

The Houses of Justice were not meant to lead on their own. Paragraphs 77 through 97 of the Kitab-i-Aqdas includes a large portion addressing the assembly of kings, particular political leaders of the time, and various lands. Many of Baha'u'llah's teachings are about the responsibilities of political leaders, the rights they are to protect, and our responsibility to those leaders. Baha'u'llah says "Now, what seems good in the British nation’s constitution, which is adorned with both the light of sovereignty and the consultation of the nation ... but the matter that is a cause of preservation and prohibition in both the outer and inner aspects, is the fear of God."[^political-leadership-1]

[^political-leadership-1]: Lawh-i-Dunya (Tablet of the World)

The "Epistle to the Son of the Wolf" provides a great example of Baha'u'llah's vision. In addressing a Shayhk who serves the Ottoman Sultan, He offers this short sermon:

> Every nation should consider the position of its ruler, be submissive to his command, act by his decree, and hold fast to his judgment. Kings are the manifestations of the power, elevation, and grandeur of God. This oppressed one has never flattered anyone; all bear witness to this fact. However, considering the status of kings is from God, and it is clear and known from the words of the Prophets and saints.
>
> In the presence of the Spirit (Jesus), it was asked: “O Spirit of God, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?” He said: “Yes, render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and unto God what is God’s.” He did not forbid it, and these two words are one to those who perceive, for what is Caesar’s would not be lawful if it were not from God. Likewise, in the blessed verse: “Obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.” The primary and foremost meaning of “those in authority” are the Imams (may the peace of God be upon them), who are the manifestations of power, the sources of command, the treasuries of knowledge, and the dawning places of divine wisdom. In the secondary rank, it refers to the kings and rulers whose light of justice illuminates and brightens the horizons of the world. It is hoped that from the Sultan (may God preserve him) a light of justice will shine that will encompass all the parties of the nations. All should ask God for what is befitting today for His sake.

This chapter will consider the derived authority from God a monarch may express, how the government derives its authority from the monarch, their responsibilities, potential opportunities leaders had in Baha'u'llah's time, and promises and prophecy God makes to certain lands (and the people therein). As seen in Baha'u'llah quoting both Jesus Christ and Muhammad, this has been a consistent teaching of God for thousands of years. Baha'u'llah gives us the framework to achieve this.

## Opportunities of Sovereign Leaders in Baha'u'llah's Time

Baha'u'llah addressed several sovereign leaders and the opportunities presented to them, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and elsewhere. This section will briefly share some of these opportunities.

### To the Emperor of Austria (Franz Joseph I)

He visited Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem in 1869 but did not enquire about Baha'u'llah, nor sense Him.[^political-leadership-2] Baha'u'llah was with the Emperor in all conditions, but the Emporer was clinging to the branch but heedless of the root. Baha'u'llah invited the Emperor to recognize Him instead of clinging to a prior Branch. Emperor Franz Joseph I missed the opportunity to express his belief in Jesus Christ by recognizing Him in a new name. Franz was a well-respected sovereign and reigned for 68 years until his death in 1916. The empire of Austria ended with his death, an outcome of World War I which started with his declaration of war against Serbia after the assassination of his heir.

[^political-leadership-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #85

### To the King of Berlin (Wilhelm I)

The Second Reich of the German Empire was formed in 1870, just 3 years prior to the revealing of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Baha'u'llah addresses Emperor Wilhelm I[^political-leadership-3] warning him about pride, and a king prior who sought to dominate the lands and rule over the people. He had originally resisted a constitutional monarchy but relented upon Otto von Bismarck's recommendation. Nevertheless, Germany remained militaristic and authoritarian with designs on restoring the Holy Roman Empire of Germany to its former glory. Wilhelm I passed away at the age of 90 in 1888.

[^political-leadership-3]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #86

### Regarding Napoleon III of France

When Baha'u'llah reminded Wilhelm I of the prior king, He was referencing a fulfilled prophecy to Napoleon III of France. In the Suriy-i-Haykal, Baha'u'llah addressed Pope Pius IX of Rome, Czar Alexander III of Russia, Queen Victoria of Great Britian, and Sultan Nasiri'd-din-Shah of Persia in addition to Napoleon III. Baha'u'llah in 1868 told Napoleon III after he claimed to fight against oppression:

> "Due to your actions, affairs in your kingdom will differ, and dominion will slip from your hand as a result. Then, you’ll find yourself in clear loss, and earthquakes will affect all tribes unless you stand in support of this cause and follow the spirit on this straight path. The honor you value won’t last, it will fade unless you hold onto this strong rope. We see humiliation following you while you are among the heedless."

By the time the KItab-i-Aqdas was revealed 5 years later, Napoleon III had been captured by Germany, and died a prisoner. He was remembered in France as a deserter of his army and was publicly humiliated. This context places the warning to Emporer Wilhelm I as an urgent warning. Pride in yourself cannot come at the cost of your country and its citizens.

### To the Kings and Presidents of the Americas

By 1873, the western hemisphere had largely become comprised of several new republics, starting with the United States of America in 1776. There was one independent King, Pedro II of Brazil, although descended from Austria's House of Habsburg. Europe also exercised colonial rule over many other lands.

Baha'u'llah instructs the Kings and Presidents to adorn the temple of dominion with the raiment of justice and piety, and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord.[^political-leadership-4] Baha'u'llah did not promise the Americas would be the light of justice and piety, but it was their responsibility to do so.

[^political-leadership-4]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #88

Appendix 7 offers a table outlining the leaders of the world in 1873. The idea is to provide context for the Kitab-i-Aqdas's place in both time and space. Maybe you may ask yourself, did these nations seize the opportunity or let the opportunity pass away? Do these opportunities still exist? I believe where these opportunities were not acted on, these opportunities still exist. It is never too late to adorn the temple of dominion with the raiment of justice and piety.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Monarchs

### We Share the Same Foundations

Monarchs have various roles and responsibilities derived from their position. Before we get into the roles and responsibilities unique to monarchs, let's start from the beginning.

In the beginning, God created the worlds and everything within them. Over time humans emerged and God gave them a unique soul. Every human's souls is created noble, regardless of their social or economic status. A person who emerges as a monarch has a soul created by God, just like you, myself, and others we know. The monarch's soul has opportunities to pass through the spiritual worlds, and believe in God, their own soul, these spiritual worlds, the Day of Resurrection, the Command of God, and the Manifestations of God.

The monarch may not believe in God, believe in Baha'u'llah, or believe in these things. Yet, these opportunities exist. They may choose to pray, remember God in worship, recite the verses of God, reflect on themselves, and honor God through various practices. They may not do these things, or even publicly say they do but in their private life do not. The monarch has opportunities to develop and refine their virtues.

The monarch is also born with the same rights we have. As they attain maturity at age 19, they have additional responsibilities and rights. They have a private life, like we do, and may struggle with illusions, delusions and desires. They have opportunities to overcome them. Monarchs have a constructive social life, and need protections of this social life. Monarchs have affectionate relationships and have responsibilities towards those in their personal life to include being trustees and participating in consultation. As you can see, for every aspect of their existence, we share the same foundations.

### Beyond Shared Foundations

The Kitab-i-Aqdas and Suriy-i-Muluk (The Tablet to the Kings) outline specific responsibilities monarchs have. This will section will list these responsibilities:

#### Spiritual Foundations of Leadership

-   Purify yourself from the wealth of the world, do not be preoccupied with wealth[^political-leadership-5]

### Additional Rights of Monarchs

Baha'u'llah did not outline any additional rights of monarchs. Once again, what is excluded is quite informative. Baha'u'llah does not say the monarch should be concerned about the protection of their government, but only the citizens and lands. This is one example and I invite you to consider what other traditional notions of governance are excluded from Baha'u'llah's directives.

## To Various Lands and Cities

Baha'u'llah had addressed various lands in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and in other writings. This section will only cover what is in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. We will see admonitions, prophecies, and encouragement. All of these are related to how the governments of these lands treat their citizens and their adversaries.

### To the Company of Rome (Byzantine Rome)

Baha'u'llah hears the sound of the owl among them.[^political-leadership-34] He asks "Has the intoxication of desire seized you, or are you among the heedless?" In 1873, the Eastern Orthodox Church was a semi-autonomous religious entity governed under the Rum millet within the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul at the time was about 50% Sunni Muslim (versus over 90% today) with the Eastern Orthodox Catholics forming a significant population. Istanbul was the home of the former Eastern Roman Empire from the 4th through 15th centuries, the home of the first Christian monarch, and nearby Anatolia was the home of the first Pauline churches. The Greek population formed an important economic, social, and political base in the Ottoman Empire, even if politically they were considered second-class citizens.

[^political-leadership-34]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #89

When Baha'u'llah addresses the company of Rome, Baha'u'llah is directly referring to Orthodox Christians governed under the Rum millet, and the historical significance Rome had in representing the community who believed in Jesus Christ. When He mentions the owl, I believe Baha'u'llah is evoking Psalms 102 from King David of Israel. I will share the full text and allow the Psalms to carry the weight of this section and the next:

> Hear my prayer, Lord; let my cry for help come to you. Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly. For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers. My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food. In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones. I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins. I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof. All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse. For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside. My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass. But you, Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations. You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come. For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity. The nations will fear the name of the Lord, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory. For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory. He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea. Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord:
>
> “The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”
>
> So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the Lord. In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days. So I said:
>
> “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations. In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years will never end. The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”

The Eastern Orthodox Church suffered greatly in Istanbul and Anatolia not long after 1873. Massacres of Armenian Christians in 1894 and 1909, the Armenian Genocide during World War I, and the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish war led to a decline the Church has never recovered from in its historical homeland. These losses were tragic and painful and still form a painful scar for many in eastern Europe.

### To the Point on the Shore of Two Seas (Istanbul)

Baha'u'llah turns His attention to the point on the shore of the two seas, which is Istanbul. He says:

> The throne of oppression has been established upon you, and the fire of hatred has been ignited within you to such an extent that it has caused lamentation in the Concourse on high and those who circle around the exalted Throne. We see within you the ignorant ruling over the wise, and darkness boasting over the light, while you are in manifest delusion. Your outward adornment has deceived you. By the Lord of creation! It will perish, and the daughters and widows, and the tribes among you, shall weep. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed give you tidings.

In 1876, the Ottoman Empire did adopt a constitutional monarchy much like how Baha'u'llah had prescribed. In 1878, Sultan Abdul Hamid II suspended the constitution. The Ottoman Empire quickly declined and by 1922, after 620 years, the Ottoman Empire was no more. Istanbul, the former Constantinople, stopped being the capital of Christendom and Sunni Islam after 1600 years.

### To the Banks of the Rhine River

Baha'u'llah addresses the rising Second Reich of the German Empire, formed in 1871 by the Prussian Wilhelm I. He says "We have seen you covered with blood, as the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and again you shall have it."[^political-leadership-35] The Franco-Prussian War was fought in 1870, another of several wars between France, Prussia (later Germany) which started in the late 1790s. The Napoleonic Wars themselves had an estimated 4-6 million casualties, and many battles were fought along the Rhine River. These wars seemed to be a never-ending cycle of retribution.

[^political-leadership-35]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #90

Baha'u'llah includes a prophecy stating that after 1873, the Rhine River banks will again be covered with blood. The Battles of Marne (1914 & 1918) and Verdun (1916) were fought during World War I. About 1.5 million casualties were reported in these three battles.

### The Lamentation of Berlin

Baha'u'llah then addresses Berlin, the capitol of the German Empire. "We hear the lamentation of Berlin, though she is now in manifest glory." Lamentation is an expression of deep sadness and regret, often due to a sense of wrongdoing. Berlin was the capitol of the most industrialized, most modern, the most militaristic, and potentially the most authoritarian government in Western Europe. The First Reich was known as the Holy Roman Empire, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the first emperor of the symbolic Western Roman Empire in the year 800. This decentralized kingdom lasted until the Napoleonic War in 1806, nearly a thousand years of rule between the Roman Catholic Church and Frankish (a German ethnicity) monarchs.

I believe the lamentation of Berlin alludes to the lost moral leadership of the Holy Roman Empire amid the increasingly violent retributive wars throughout Europe, plus the repercussions throughout the world through colonialism and imperialism. The centralized Second Reich was not the same as the decentralized First Reich. The first was moderated by the influence of Christianity, while the second was no longer restrained by religious authority. The retributive wars in Europe did not end until World War 2, once the Third Reich was defeated.

Sadly, retribution endured as a consequence of the unraveling of moral authority once diffused and restrained across Eastern Rome, Western Rome, and the Sunni Caliphate. These traditions, despite their failures and imperfections, governed in reference to God rather than unconstrained force. As centralization displaced trusteeship and power slipped free from humility and law, the lands once oriented toward Jerusalem inherited cycles of violence instead of peace.

### To the Lands Within Persia

The next section addresses the people and lands of Persia, where Baha'u'llah was born, raised, imprisoned, and exiled from.

#### To The Land of Ṭā (Tehran)

Baha'u'llah describes Tehran as the place where the Dawn of Manifestation was born[^political-leadership-36], referencing the appearance of the Holy Maiden to Him in the Siyah-Chal prison of Tehran in 1852. Tehran is the source of the world's joy, so do not grieve over anything. He then offers two promises, one is conditional and the other is not.

[^political-leadership-36]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #91 - #93

The conditional promise relies on whether God will it or not. This promise is Tehran will be blessed by a sovereign leader who will rule with justice and gather the scattered sheep (believers) from the wolves. He will greet the people of Baha (those who believe in Baha'u'llah) with joy and gladness.

The unconditional promise has two parts. The first part is the masses will pass judgment upon Tehran, with things being overturned within Tehran. Yet, when this happens, be at peace because the divine bounty will not cease from you. After this period, tranquility will follow the turmoil. This promise has been decreed by God.

The unconditional promise does not require the conditional promise to be fulfilled. The period of turmoil and the period of tranquility are inevitable. It is hard to pinpoint any moment as being the specific turmoil. There was the civil war of 1908 to 1910 which ushered a constitutional revolution, the American-led coup in 1953 which replaced the constitution with absolute monarchy, and then the Islamic Revolution of 1979 which overthrew the monarchy with a constitutional theocracy based on Shi'a Islam. Each of these could be the turmoil depending on perspective, the entire period could be a part of a greater turmoil, or maybe it has not happened yet. Depending on what you believe the turmoil is, might inform what you believe the period of tranquility will be thereafter. No matter what, I do hope Tehran can become illuminated by that light from the Dawn of Revelation.

#### To the Land of Khá (Khurasan)

Baha'u'llah says "O Land of Khá! We hear within you the voices of men extolling your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Blessed is the day when the banners of the Names are raised in the Kingdom of Creation in My Most Glorious Name. On that day, the sincere will rejoice in the victory of God, while the disbelievers will lament."[^political-leadership-37]

[^political-leadership-37]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #94

I have wondered if this could mean Khurasan as the current province of Iran, or the greater historical area of Khurasan which includes modern cities such as Herat (Afghanistan), Bukhara (Uzbekistan), and Ashgabat (Turkmenistan). These areas were first included with the name Khurasan during the Zoroastrian Sasanian Empire in the 6th century. Where might a Kingdom begin which establishes the banners of the Names of God in His Most Glorious Name (Baha'u'llah)?

#### To the Land of Kāf and Rā

The final land from Persia mentioned by Baha'u'llah is the land of Kāf and Rā (Kirman). This paragraph #164 is immediately part of a series of paragraphs addressed to religious scholars. Baha'u'llah has witnessed that which He has chosen to remain a secret. However, I infer the later clause regarding the insinuations of the learned and the doubts of the skeptics to be potentially related to this secret.

One potential aspect of history which this may allude to is related to the husbands of two of Baha'u'llah's nieces, the daughters of Mirza Yahya (Subh-i-Azal). Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani and Sheikh Ahmad Rouhi were Azali Babi's who were influential in the revolutionary movements in the late 1800's Persia. In 1875, just 2 years after this paragraph was revealed by Baha'u'llah, they went to various cities of Persia and later to Constantinople to garner support for greater freedoms for Persians. In 1896, Kermani assassinated Naser al-Din Shah and both were beheaded.

The followers of Baha'u'llah have long been associated with the assassination of the Shah and other revolutionary movements of Persia, despite Kermani and Rouhi writing public treatises against Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah says "no one should object to those who rule over the people"[^political-leadership-38] which is a clear instruction against revolution and rebellion.

[^political-leadership-38]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #95

## Conclusion

As we can see, Baha'u'llah has a clear vision about the roles and responsibilities of kings and queens. This vision is direct from God. We can also look back into history and see the issues caused when kings, queens, and various leaders act contrary to this vision. The people under their rule and guidance suffer greatly. Early in this book I had briefly discussed suffering and ways to be liberated from suffering. While spiritual practice is the foundation, the pathways of suffering and the liberation therefrom also exist in the ways we organize and govern ourselves. John Locke had argued in 1689's "Two Treatises of Government" that political authority is based on the consent of the people. Do we consent to suffer or do we consent to be liberated from suffering?

To answer this question, we realize common mechanisms of change are not true pathways. Revolution, rebellion, and even protest do not consistently ease suffering or cause progress without consequences. The next chapter will help us look at this question with a different lens. We will look at spiritual and religious leadership in general in Chapter 24 and specifically at Baha'u'llah's vision for the Cause of God after His passing. These are all components of what we consent to, how we express consent, and reduce the suffering we and the generations after us experience.
