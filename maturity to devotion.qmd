## The First Responsibility

In the prior chapter we established some basic rights all people have from conception until maturity. In this chapter, we will begin a series of chapters of life once maturity is reached and the devotional identity expected of a Person of Baha. This devotional identity will guide and inform all rights and responsibilities for the remainder of Part 3. Maturity is an important concept as societies in general have struggled with defining it and expressing what rights and responsibilities exist around it.

Before explaining what maturity is, I want to introduce what I believe is the first responsibility we have at maturity. Baha'u'llah says "no one should object to those who rule over the people."[^maturity-to-devotion-1] Instead of objecting to rule, we should leave leaders to what they have, such as their power, and focus our attention on the hearts of people. This is also a right. Every person has the right to peacefully be led. They also have the right and responsibility to guide hearts, through their conduct and speech. Every responsibility a person has from maturity must be exercised in a way which does not overstep the bounds of law, no matter where you live. To change or influence law and leadership, the changing of hearts is the core of the devotional identity.

[^maturity-to-devotion-1]: Kitab-i-Aqdas #95

Maturity will be a good way to help understand how to frame this concept.

## What is Maturity?

The Kitab-i-Aqdas mentions maturity twice. The first is when prayer and fasting become obligatory[^maturity-to-devotion-2] and when to receive inheritance.[^maturity-to-devotion-3] On the latter right, Baha'u'llah conditions trusteeship if the descendant is weak instead of being mature. What might weakness be related to?

[^maturity-to-devotion-2]: Kitab-i-Aqdas 10

[^maturity-to-devotion-3]: Kitab-i-Aqdas 27

Weakness is usually associated with physical strength, but strength is not a sole determination of maturity. I believe weakness in this case is associated with two major characteristics. The first would be a person who lacks firmness in character, or maybe someone who is still understanding who they are as a person. The second characteristic would be the inability to function normally or fully. This might be a level of codependency, whether it be financial or emotional, which does not exist when someone is mature.

To support these ideas, we can look further in Baha'u'llah's revelation. In the Lawh-i-Rais (A Tablet to a Chief), Baha'u'llah closes with an instruction for Ali Pasha. He says "Ask God to help you reach maturity so that you become aware of the beauty and ugliness of deeds and actions." To reach maturity, one must understand the consequences of their actions. The Kitab-i-Aqdas also conditions marriage upon the consent of both potential spouses.

With these conditions, let's look at how the Badi calendar's progression through the maturation process.

## The Badi Calendar's Rhythm of Maturity

A person matures through three stages at the ages of 11, 15, and 19. The numbers 11, 15, and 19 are not arbitrary. They correspond to the months Mashíyyat (Will), Masá’il (Questions), and ‘Alá (Loftiness) in the Badi calendar. This is the divine rhythm by which the world itself matures. Thus, even time testifies that the awakening of awareness, the assumption of will, and the perfection of trust are one continuous act of God’s creation. By the time a person turns 19, they would have completed 19 cycles of 19 months, a complete Vahid of life. This is the essence of unity. This section will be focused on the Bab's teachings of maturity. Baha'u'llah made no changes to the Bab's Command regarding maturity.

### At Age 11

Age 11 corresponds to God's name Huwa.[^maturity-to-devotion-4] Huwa is composed of two Arabic letters “Ha” (ه) letter “Waw” (و). Baha'u'llah says the letter Ha corresponds with God's inward identification and indexing of Himself as "He."[^maturity-to-devotion-5] Every other name is derived from this name. The name Waw, which means Will, represents the outward expression of Him. In the Badi calendar's rhythm of maturity, at age 11 thus would represent the potential of a person to become aware of their identity. Once aware of your identity, you are capable of expressing your identity through your will. This combination of identity and will forms the legal notion of consent, as well as the ability to believe and express belief.

[^maturity-to-devotion-4]: The Persian Bayan Vahid 8, Gate 18

[^maturity-to-devotion-5]: Tafsir-i-Hu (Interpretation of "He")

The Bab teaches at this age of Mashiyyat, a person is ready to fast and perform other spiritual practices. There is a spiritual practice the Bab taught that He wanted parents to teach their children at age 11 which I find quite interesting. He says they should be taught the knowledge of the bounty of God and write the Temples of Unity, which was first fashioned through the first Temple, the Temple of the Letter Ha.[^maturity-to-devotion-6] These Temples of Unity are 19 Temples which each include 11 units from the Names of God. They may be created in the form the child desires. For each day of the month, the child is to recite what they wrote within the temple, which begins a cycle which has a beginning and an end. It's a way to take the sacred rhythm of the Badi calendar and make a sacred rhythm of the soul from it. The full instructions are within the Book of the Five Modes.

[^maturity-to-devotion-6]: The Book of the Five Modes (BB00005)

### At Age 15

Age 15 marks the second state of maturity according to the Badi calendar. This would mark the time when we reach the age of reason and moral awareness.[^maturity-to-devotion-7] The Bab says when this age is reached, this is when you are fully capable to choose your religion. We can say a person has progressed not just in knowing who they are and what they choose, they have the ability to understand the full consequences of their choices and actions through their ability to reason. Reason is also the ability to declare your intention or what you know is true.

[^maturity-to-devotion-7]: BB00083

### At Age 19

19 marks the age of loftiness, when a person has progressed through each stage of development. You are complete. Age 19 marks the age of adulthood. This also marks the age when a person should be financially independent.[^maturity-to-devotion-8] This also marks the final stage of spiritual development, where again a person may affirm their belief and have full ability to recognize the Manifestation of God.[^maturity-to-devotion-9]

[^maturity-to-devotion-8]: The Arabic Bayan Vahid 10, Gate 14

[^maturity-to-devotion-9]: The Book of Names

To mark this age, a person should render thanksgiving for the day of his conception as an embryo.[^maturity-to-devotion-10] This also suggests the possibility we not just observe a birthday, but we celebrate the conception date as marking the age of a person. This also marks the first time we have the responsibility to practice reflection.

[^maturity-to-devotion-10]: The Persian Bayan Vahid 5, Gate 4

### Progression Through Stages of Maturity

While there is a right for each person to be able to mature according to this sacred time, a child may not fully be able to. The Bab understood this and was compassionate. For example, He says if a child is unable to demonstrate their capability at age 11, then re-evaluate at age 15, and again at age 19 if needed.[^maturity-to-devotion-11] He describes this as observing the conditions of limitation. One condition of limitation would be to recognize a person under the age 19 is not fully mature and is a child. The rights described in the last chapter remain intact. Once again, a person cannot be forced to mature before they are ready. But, a person should also not be denied their maturation if they are ready.

[^maturity-to-devotion-11]: BB00083

There are times when a person suffers from developmental handicaps which prevent their ability to be fully mature. To determine whether a person is fully mature at the age 19 threshold requires careful consultation and consideration of certain qualities. These qualities would be financial and emotional independence, firmness in character and identity, and is able to understand the consequences of their actions. Remember, it is the right of every person to mature, but they also have a right to be free from being forced to be mature before they are ready.

### The Laws of Maturity and Consent in Nations

With the first responsibility stated earlier, it would be wise to consult the laws of the land you live in. In Persia and the Ottoman Empire of the late 19th century, consent and maturity were determined to be 15 years of age. In the Qajar dynasty, the prerequisite age to be a King was 18 years. Where the laws which have jurisdiction do explicitly say, those laws need to be followed if they are more strict. For example, as of this writing Bahrain's law is age 21 and South Korea is 20. These ages of maturity and consent would need to be followed instead of the stages of 11, 15, and 19. While nations may govern legal maturity, none govern the spiritual progression which establishes the devotional identity of a mature person.

## The Devotional Identity of a Mature Adult

Maturity marks the official beginning of the devotional identity of an adult, if they choose to do so. Baha'u'llah says in tablet BH00528:

> When man attaineth the age of maturity, he must investigate and, putting his trust in God and sanctified from love and hate, reflect upon that whereunto the people adhere. He must hear with his own ears and see with his own eyes, for if he looketh through the eyes of another, he will be deprived of beholding the effulgent rays of the Sun of Divine Knowledge. Various parties exist in the world, and each hath regarded itself as being in the right, as He, exalted be He, hath said: “Each party rejoiceth in what it possesseth.”

He goes on to say the "understanding of every soul must.... behold itself independent."[^maturity-to-devotion-12] This establishes the next set of rights and responsibilities of every person after they reach maturity. We have the right to independently seek truth and the responsibility to be independent as we seek truth. To be a Person of Baha means to actively believe in and see the truth of Baha'u'llah, not to do so blindly. If there is a criticism or argument against Baha'u'llah or the People of Baha, do not turn your back on it. Investigate. Always be diligent in understanding each side of an argument or perspective, much like a judge allowing both a prosecutor and defender in cross examining evidence while presenting their cases. We have the responsibility to do the spiritual work ourselves, not to defer it upon others.

[^maturity-to-devotion-12]: BH00601

## Right to Belief

Every mature person has a right to believe as they wish, even if Baha'u'llah says this comes with consequences. You may not believe in anything in Part 1 of this book, or maybe have partial belief. You might even believe in Baha'u'llah but are part of an organization which claims infallibility. This is your right. Baha'u'llah says it is the responsibility of every mature adult to reflect on what people adhere, see with your own eyes, and react from there. His hope is to be one with the People of Baha, but this hope comes without coercion.

A person of Baha has the right and responsibility to every spiritual practice described in Part 2, and the right and responsibility to develop their own Unity Constellation of virtues. Those who are not a person of Baha has the right to practice any or all of these practices and develop any or all of those virtues according to their belief. None should ever be deprived, no matter who they are.

## Spiritual Accountability

There are various guidelines in the Kitab-i-Aqdas which focus on aspects of spiritual accountability. For each guideline, they will be presented as both a right and responsibility.

### Looking Inward

The first sphere of spiritual accountability begins within the soul itself. There is a responsibility not to measure the Book of God by your own desires, and a corresponding right to measure your desires according to the Book of God. There is a responsibility not to object to the fragrance of God, which is His love, and a right to receive that love fully. There is a responsibility not to withhold yourself from the bounties and grace of God, and a right to receive them. There is a responsibility not to question Bahá'u'lláh's actions, and a right to believe those actions reflect the Will of God, who represents all names to include the Most Subtle. These four accountabilities share a common thread — the soul must be oriented toward God before it can look anywhere else.

### Looking Outward

The second sphere extends from the soul into its relationship with the Cause and the world. There is a responsibility not to oppose or object to Bahá'u'lláh, and a right to support His Cause. There is a responsibility not to hesitate in following His command, and a right to trust and act sincerely in implementing the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. There is a responsibility not to corrupt the Cause of God, and a right to allow the Cause to reform the Earth. There is a responsibility not to deny what God has permitted, and a right to be free from the tyranny of those who deny what God has permitted or allow what God has forbidden. Finally, there is a responsibility never to deviate from a verse's outward meaning, and a right to interpret both its outward and inward meanings. A soul oriented inward toward God will naturally begin to see the world through that same orientation.

### Action

The third sphere is where orientation becomes conduct. There is a responsibility not to destroy what God has built, and a right to what God has built and created. There is a responsibility to raise up the Sacred Houses and the places whereupon the Throne of the Lord rested. There is a responsibility to ask about the Cause of God and what your soul needs, and a right to receive those answers. These are not passive accountabilities. They require a soul that has already done the inward work and looked outward with clarity, and is now ready to build.

## The Right to Spiritual Maturity

The writings of Baha'u'llah often refer to another kind of maturity, spiritual maturity. Even if you have reached maturity in the traditional sense, it does not mean you have reached spiritual maturity. To help describe what spiritual maturity is, Baha'u'llah does use the traditional descriptions of maturity as symbols for the spiritual side.

The Kitab-i-Badi is the largest single book by Baha'u'llah, written in response to questions from a man who followed Mirza Yahya, denying belief in Baha'u'llah as a Manifestation of God. This section will not go into a discussion of Mirza Yahya (see Chapter 24 - Spiritual Leadership). A significant portion of this book discusses the conditions and reasons for lack of belief in individuals, especially those who are led by those who claim belief in God yet are spiritually corrupt.

The first right of spiritual maturity is for a spiritual infant to be from receiving the knowledge of spiritual maturity. There is a corresponding responsibility for a teacher or other person to only give the knowledge of spiritual maturity to those who are capable and ready. This requires a high level for discernment. The Kitab-i-Badi says "most today are considered infants before God." Part of this lack of maturity is due to their constellation of virtues are not valued, such as the virtue of heedfulness. A sign of maturation is belief in the Manifestation of God.

The Kitab-i-Iqan discusses extensively why people lack this development. Baha'u'llah places considerable blame on religious leaders and institutions who inhibit spiritual maturity. They do this by distorting the Words of God by changing meanings, saying God said things God did not, or by interpreting verses against their explicit intent. These distortions introduce new doctrines, traditions, superstitions, and laws which God had not intended. A spiritually immature person struggles to understand what God actually wants in their life, such as these rights and responsibilities being discussed. The weak and immature are easily led astray by others who fabricate such distortions.[^maturity-to-devotion-13]

[^maturity-to-devotion-13]: Lawh-i-Sirraj

The rights and responsibilities of spiritual accountability from the Kitab-i-Aqdas is the foundation to spiritual maturity. Even if you do not believe in Baha'u'llah, these principles are incredibly vital to your spiritual health. I personally believe if any person who is part of any religion is able to see what is from God (the source), they have a great chance to reach spiritual maturity. What I mean is if a Christian were to focus on the actual teachings and example of Jesus Christ as the primary source of their religious practice and understanding, while choosing to use all other sources such as the teachings of Saint Paul or their local pastor as secondary, they may have a great opportunity to mature in their God consciousness. "Today, knowledge and ignorance, high and low, nearness and distance, truth and falsehood, life and death, maturity and infancy, wisdom and heedlessness, are all distinguished by the confirmation of the manifestation."[^maturity-to-devotion-14] With this said, I do believe in what the Kitab-i-Aqdas says in its opening in believing in the Manifestation of God in this age. God says this is the source of all spiritual maturity.

[^maturity-to-devotion-14]: Kitab-i-Badi

The next right is to be allowed to attain the station of spiritual maturity. Each person has a responsibility to attain spiritual maturity and each person has a responsibility to allow others the ability to reach spiritual maturity, according to their capacities. Baha'u'llah says the children of the age must be nurtured with milk that is delicate and subtle until they attain maturity.[^maturity-to-devotion-15] An associated responsibility is for a person to no longer be moved by desires and illusions.[^maturity-to-devotion-16]

[^maturity-to-devotion-15]: BH00302

[^maturity-to-devotion-16]: Words of Paradise

## Responsibilities of Spiritual Maturity

There are two important responsibilities for a person who has attained spiritual maturity. These responsibilities do not come with associated rights. The first responsibility of spiritual maturity is to never exceed your station.[^maturity-to-devotion-17] Baha'u'llah says a person can do this by purifying your soul from the world, not speaking of what you do not know, and refraining from mentioning what you do not understand. It is acceptable not to know everything. It is also acceptable to stay away from being placed on a pedestal. It would be worse if you placed yourself, or allowed others to place you in a position which replaces the Manifestation of God.

[^maturity-to-devotion-17]: Kitab-i-Badi

The next responsibility for a spiritually mature person is to convey God's Cause.[^maturity-to-devotion-18] This responsibility is reserved only for the spiritually mature. A person who does not place the Manifestation of God as the primary source of God's Will is unable to convey God's Cause. They will distort God's Cause. The purpose of conveying God's Cause is for others to reach spiritual maturity. Spiritual maturity is the station where the soul has reached liberation. The liberation of the soul is a right afforded to all people.

[^maturity-to-devotion-18]: BH00035

> This is the day that the Most Great Spirit foretold and proclaimed in the wilderness of yearning by His name. Those who drink of the wine must act with wisdom, engage in the proclamation of the Cause, and, in all matters, cling to the cord of consultation and hold fast to the hem of compassion, so that the children of the age may attain maturity through the kindness and mercy of the divine sages and be nourished in complete health.[^maturity-to-devotion-19]

[^maturity-to-devotion-19]: BH00123

## Conclusion

Maturity is a right and in itself, marks the beginning of great responsibility. When combined with our constellation of virtues, our increased awareness of God's names and attributes, we can be sure to develop both our legal status of maturity, but also our spiritual station of maturity. This pattern of maturity exists in every layer of creation, exists within manifestation and command, and is a pattern I have leaned into greatly when writing this book. Everything is within this cycle of maturity, to include you and me. We must be careful to recognize, respect, and honor that which is not mature. The mature are the trustees of the immature.

With this, we take these responsibilities and look at what it means to be mature within our private lives. How do we prepare ourselves to be less immature so that we can manifest our maturity into the world? Chapter 16 will continue this cycle of maturity and look into our private lives.
