## Qualities of Disbelievers

People of error

Like the ignorant masses

They hold onto their own conjectures and illusions.

Clung to their own principles instead of those of God

Sorrowful.

Seek prestige

Claim hidden knowledge.

Claim esoteric understanding

Denied what God has permitted

Borne ascetic hardships

Makes actions the partner of hopes.

Among the dead

## Deceived by Knowledge

Veiled from God's Name, the Self-Subsisting. See themselves as greater than Nimrod. They worship their own idols of desire.

## They are Asleep

If they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts towards God. Their sleep is caused by the intoxication of desire, in such a way they cannot see the Lord. They will awaken but not find anything of what they missed in the days of the Lord.

Glory of the Exalted Will Not Endure

The Ornaments of the Wealthy Will Not Endure

The Power of the Wicked Will Not Endure

## How to Act Towards Them

We should act in a way where their own sorrows do not overcome us.
