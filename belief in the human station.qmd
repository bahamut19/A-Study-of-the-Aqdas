## All are Servants

Servitude reveals human stations, such as the praiseworthy station.

nor is this a station into which every timid and deluded soul may enter. By God, this is the arena of unveiling and detachment, the field of vision and exaltation. None traverse it except the knights of the All-Merciful, who have cast aside all that is created. These are the helpers of God on earth and the dawning places of might among the worlds.

### Exalted and Noble Station

## All are Signs

## Brought to Life with a Spirit from Him

if you attain what We reveal, you will ask from the grace of God for Him to reign upon your innermost selves, for that is a glory beyond reach.

## Created From Water

## Temples of Humankind

## Crimson Ark

## Souls Take Flight

He desired for you that which you do not know today; it will be known to the people when souls take flight and the rugs of joy are rolled up.

## Return to Dust

## Above Animals

## The Suspicious Soul

## The Capacity

This is My mention according to your capacity, not according to the measure of God. This is attested by what is in the knowledge of God, if only you knew, and by the Tongue of God, if only you understood. By God, were the veil to be lifted, you would be thunderstruck.
