## All are Servants

Servitude reveals human stations

Servitude elevates human ranks

Servitude elevates human remembrances

### Exalted and Noble Station

## All are Signs

## Brought to Life with a Spirit from Him

if you attain what We reveal, you will ask from the grace of God for Him to reign upon your innermost selves, for that is a glory beyond reach.

## Created From Water

## Temples of Humankind

## Crimson Ark

## Souls Take Flight

He desired for you that which you do not know today; it will be known to the people when souls take flight and the rugs of joy are rolled up.

## Return to Dust

## Above Animals

## The Suspicious Soul
